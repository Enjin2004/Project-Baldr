Useless weaklings, the lot of you[...][N]
Stand back! I'll do it myself![A][X]

Lady Ethlyn?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Alec! You're alright![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course! You're looking as lovely[N]
as ever.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Uhh[...] Thank you, I was worried[N]
about you all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You didn't think these[N]
barbarians would best ME, did you?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You can never be too careful, Alec.[...][N]
Is my brother Sigurd safe?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Of course, m'lady. Lord Sigurd's fine[N]
and working harder than any of us![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank goodness! Quan, Finn, and I arrived[N]
as soon as we heard the news.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lady Ethlyn, your benevolent spirit[N]
knows no bounds![A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
I could not sleep if I knew everyone[N]
everyone back in Chalphy was in danger[...][A][CloseSpeechSlow][N]
Sigurd may be my brother, and yet[...][A][N][ToggleSmile]
You, Naoise, and Arden are just[N]
like family to me as well![A][N]
Even with my marriage, I couldn't[N]
stay back and do nothing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm graced by your generous[N]
words, Lady Ethlyn![A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's the least I can do for[N][ToggleSmile]
you and the others, Alec.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If I may, m'lady, it's dangerous for you to[N]
remain on the frontlines like that.[A][N]
These savages from Verdane are ruthless, and[N]
will give no quarter to even a lady as you.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][N][ToggleSmile]
Say[...] I think you'll appreciate[N]
this gift I have for you![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh![...] You're giving me one of[N]
your swords, Alec?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That blade you have alone won't be[N][ToggleSmile]
enough to defend yourself, my lady.[A][N]
It would pain me for an eternity[N]
if any harm were to befall you![A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
You have my sincerest thanks, Alec.[N]
I promise I'll put this to good use.[A][N]
And with that, I must be off to battle![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Promise me to stay out of danger if you can.[A][N]
It'd be tragic if your[N]
beautiful face was scarred.[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh, Alec[...][A][N]
Some things never change,[N]
do they[...][A][X]

##SorryAideen
[OpenMidRight][LoadAideen][OpenMidLeft][LoadMidir]
Milady, The castle's completely[N]
surrounded! We've failed you miserably![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Midir, it's alright, Everyone gave his best.[N]
You needn't worry about me any longer.[A][N]
Please save yourself, I want as many[N]
of you to get out of this alive as possible![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We aren't going anywhere, milady.[N]
We're here for you till the very end.[A][N]
Even if it means our lives![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh[...]thank you, Midir, I'm so sorry to[N]
put you through all this.[A][X]

##ChalphyDudes
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNoish][OpenRight][LoadSigurd]
Munnir's army already has Yngvi[N]
surrounded. Edain is in grave danger![A][N]
Naoise, I'm going to help her. I'm leaving[N]
Chalphy in your hands.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hold, milord. Surely you don't[N]
intend to go alone?[A][N][OpenRight]
Nearly all of our forces are[N]
already on the march to Isaach[A][N]
with Father, there's hardly anybody[N]
left to call upon, they may be simple[A][N]
savages, but Verdane's army is still huge.[N]
I can't risk your lives by forcing[A][N]
you to face them.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Perish the thought, milord![A][N]
I was born a knight, and I will[N]
gladly risk dying a knight's death[A][N]
in your name, to allow our lord[N]
to die alone in battle would be[A][N]
an unspeakable disgrace, we shall[N]
be by your side, every step of the way.[A][N]
Alec, I trust you're of the same mind?[A][N][OpenLeft][LoadAlec]
Yeah, of course! But there's more[N]
than just Yngvi at stake, we've[A][N]
got to stop by the nearby villages first.[N]
Those thugs'll try to beat us to them[A][N]
and they'll loot, massacre, and burn them[N]
all down if they do, we've gotta get there[A][N]
first, and lend the locals a hand in[N]
locking the villages down[A][N]
and fortifying their defenses.[A][N][OpenRight]
Absolutely. We mustn't neglect[N]
our knightly duties to the people[A][N]
especially not at a time like this.[N]
Good point, Alec.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Actually, that was all Oifey's idea.[A][N]
That kid's every bit the tactician[N]
they say he is, give him a few years[A][N]
and he'll be a match for his old grandpa,[N]
Lord Sesar![A][N][OpenRight]
Oifey's still around the castle,[N]
Huh[...]Oifey! I know you're here.[A][N]
You can come out now![A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOifey]My apologies for still being here, sire.[A][N]
Still, if you would allow it, I'd like to[N]
join you in battle, I can't just sit back[A][N]
while you risk your lives.[A][N][OpenRight]
I don't know[...]You're still so young.[N]
Are you sure you're ready for this?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I'm already fourteen, sire, I may not[N]
be battle ready just yet, but there's[A][N]
still so much I can do to support you.[N]
Please, allow me to accompany you.[A][N]
I swear I won't let you down.[A][N][OpenRight]
Fair enough, Oifey, After all[N]
you've already spent two years[A][N]
training as my squire, real battlefield[N]
experience would be fantastic for[A][N]
your training, but you're still definitely[N]
not up to actual combat duty for now.[A][N]
How about you ride with me[N]
as my advisor instead?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Y-yes! Thank you, sire! Thank you![A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNoish]Milord, what of the defense of Chalphy[N]
itself in our absence? Leaving the castle[A][N]
unattended is risky, should the enemy[N]
slip past us, an unguarded castle will fall[A][N]
easily and spell us a swift end.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Naoise, I'd say there's only one man[N]
who we can depend upon for that[A][N]
[...]Eh, Arden?[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadArden]
Hold on a moment! Why me, Alec?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Sturdy as a brick wall! Strong as an ox![N]
Slow as a turtle! Face it, Arden,[A][N]
you were born for guard duty! Haha![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Pah[...]I'm strong and tough, I know,[N]
but you really don't need to call me slow![A][N][OpenRight]
He has a point, Arden, would you?[N]
You're the most apt at guard duty.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Sigh[...]Fine, I'll do it. But you have to[N]
bring me with you at least once![A][N]
I don't want to be left out of the action.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right, men, it's time to set out.[A][N]
Let's start by assisting the villages,[N]
and then it's onward to Yngvi![A][X]

##MunnirRektsMidir
[OpenMidLeft][LoadMunnir]
Kehehe[...]You! Not bad for being[N]
here all on your lonesome.[A][N]
but I've had enough of your[N]
struggling![A][X]

##MunnirTaketh
[OpenLeft][LoadMunnir][OpenMidRight][LoadAideen]
Ah! Midir[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
Well, well, looks like we have quite[N]
the gem here, and Yngvi's princess[A][N]
to boot! You're coming home with me,[N]
dearie, Listen up. DiMaggio, I'm heading back.[A][N]
You and Gerrard are in charge.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadDimaggio]
Er, yes, sir[...][A][N][OpenLeft]
Hah, relax! Won't be long, and I'll be[N]
bringing Cimbaeth's lot along for the fun.[A][N]
When I do, all Grannvale's our oyster.[A][N]
Even Belhalla ought to be easy pickings,[N]
what with nobody around to stop us![A][N]
The kingdom's all ours, boys![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Leave it to us, sir![A][X]

##Dawdling

##Destroythebridge
[OpenMidRight][LoadKinbois][OpenMidLeft][LoadMunnir]

of those Grannvale worms crossing over here![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course, Brother.[A][X]

##MouthWater
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGerrard][OpenFarRight][LoadAideen]
[OpenRight][LoadMunnir]Oi, Gerrard, I'm going back to Marpha[N]
for now. You're in charge of the border.[A][N]
Stay sharp, we clear?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, Sir, but, er, your lordship[...][N]
Who's that there dame you have?[A][N][OpenRight]
The spoils of war, m'boy! She's[N]
coming back to Marpha to marry me.[A][N]
Whaddya think? A real keeper, eh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll say! Just looking at her's[N]
makin' me mouth water.[A][N][OpenRight]
Back off! This one's mine.[A][N]
You'll have your pick of all Grannvale[N]
once we're done here. Keep it in your[A][N]
pants a little longer, yeah?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What animals[...]Gods above,[N]
I implore you, bestow upon these[A][N]
men a hint of human decency[...][A][N][OpenRight]
Oi, what're you mumbling about now?[N]
We're outta here. No dawdling, y'hear?[A][X]

##MilkTheVillage
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDimaggio]
Get to work, boys![N]
Our next stop's Chalphy.[A][N]
Don't forget to milk the[N]
villages for all they got![A][X]

##TheyArriveth
[OpenMidRight][LoadLex][OpenMidLeft][LoadAzel]
Well, Lex, looks like we made it[N]
in time.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Geez[...] Looks like Sigurd is taking on[N]
the entire Verdane army![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm sure he'll be happy to have the[N]
help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Geez, you just can't stay out of[N]
these things, can you, Azelle[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, but with the standing forces[N]
engaging Isaach, Grannvale's[A][N]
completely strapped,[N]
so when I heard what was happening,[A][N]
I had to come![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, I get that, but I'm not buying[N]
your story. What aren't you telling[A][N]
me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wh[...]what're you talking about?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd guess that you're all worked up[N]
about lady Edain of Yngvi, I know[A][N]
you like her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]You're nuts!!![A][N][OpenMidRight]
A-ha! Face is getting red there,[N]
buddy! You little player you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lex, knock it off![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hahaha[...] Alright let's do this.[N]
Finally, a chance to fight![A][X]

##LensterArriveth
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFinn][OpenMidRight][LoadEthlyn]
[OpenLeft][LoadQuan]Looks like we're not too late. I hope[N]
Sigurd is alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sure my brother's fine, but he has[N]
no one around him that can use magic.[A][N]
I'm sure I can put my staff to some[N]
use around here.[A][N]
I'm sorry to pull you into this, Quan.[N]
I know I'm no longer a Chalphy, but I[A][N]
can't just sit back and do nothing.[A][N]
On my brother's behalf, thank you so[N]
much for coming.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You don't need to thank me, Ethlyn.[N]
You know Sigurd and I go way back.[A][N]
Not to mention that he's my[N]
brother-in-law now.[A][N]
Besides, I can't[N]
have you fighting alone.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I sure appreciate it, dear.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Forgive me for interrupting, but we[N]
should hurry.[A][N]
The battle is just up ahead.[A][X]

##MidirRescueth

Oh?[...]That's Midir![N]
Midir, hold on! What happened here![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadMidir]
Uh[...]You..are[...]Lord[...]Sigurd?[A][N][OpenRight]
Are you alright, Midir?[N]
Where's Edain?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...]don't know. But Munnir[...][A][N][OpenRight]
Munnir[...] That's all I need to hear[N]
Midir, I'll do all I can to rescue her.[A][N]
You stay here and rest up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can't, sir, I've got to help![A][N]
I can't stand staying here,[N]

Are you alright, Midir?[N]
Where's Edain?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Midir, I'll do all I can to rescue her.[A][N]
You stay here and rest up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can't, sir, I've got to help![A][N]
I can't stand staying here,[N]
knowing those thugs still have her![A][X]

##AlbusCometh
[OpenMidRight][LoadArvis]
When His Majesty asked me to[N]
observe the battle, I hardly expected[A][N]
to see Chalphy struggle so against[N]
simple barbarians, Sigurd[...]So this[A][N]
is all you've amounted to[...][A][X]

##StuffedUp
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGerrard]
DiMaggio stuffed up, huh?[...][N]
Shoulda known he was worthless![A][N]
Prince Munnir's not gonna like this[...][A][N]
Put the bridge back up, boys![N]
We ain't gonna blow it like DiMaggio![A][X]

##StuffedUpArden
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGerrard]
DiMaggio stuffed up, huh?[...]Shoulda[N]
known by how long he was taking![A][N]
Prince Munnir's not gonna like this[...][A][N]
Put the bridge back up, boys![N]
We ain't gonna blow it like DiMaggio![A][X]

##SalamanderTime
[OpenMidRight][LoadArvis][OpenMidLeft][LoadAzelle]
Brother[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Azelle, what are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Verdane's barbarians crossed the border[N]
and captured Lady Edain. I came to help[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You threw yourself into harm's way[N]
over your silly infatuations?[A][N]
Surely you jest, little brother.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] um[...] it's not.. like that..[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's exactly like that, do not protest.[N]
Father is long dead.[A][N]
As the eldest and the lord of Velthomer,[N]
I am your guardian and liege.[A][N]
You should not have left[N]
without my permission.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am sorry, brother, that I[N]
did not consult you.[A][N]
But I am a man now and I'm able[N]
to make my own decisions.[A][N]
What good am I or the abilities I possess if I[N]
can't use them to help my friends and country?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[CloseEyes]Do as you will then.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]I'm hard on you and that's because[N]
you're not just my little brother,[A][N]
you're the only family I have left.[A][N]
But I can't just lock you[N]
in and keep you prisoner.[A][N]
I trust that you will be[N]
careful and not get yourself killed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Thank you, brother![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Take this and give them a taste of Hell.[A][X]

##SilverSwordTime
[OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurdLeft][OpenMidRight][LoadArvis]
It has been too long, Master Sigurd.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Arvis! Why are you-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
His Majesty is concerned, and he[N]
bade me to come and observe.[A][N]
He also entrusted me[N]
with this - a gift for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is[...]a Silver Sword! A gift[N]
from His Majesty? Oh, what an honor.[A][N]
Lord Arvis, be sure to pass my deepest[N]
gratitude for this onto the king![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Incidentally, Sigurd,[N]
rumor has it that my brother, Azelle[A][N]
is among your forces.[N]
I presume this is true?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm, sorry about that. It sounded as[N]
if he came behind your back, but I[A][N]
couldn't turn him away. If at all[N]
possible, would you mind if he[A][N]
remained with me for a while longer?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[...] So long as you keep him safe,[N]
then. He and I may have different mothers,[A][N]
But Azelle is still my only brother.[N]
I'd prefer if he remained by my side.[A][N]
but perhaps this is how it must be[...][N]
I'll entrust Azelle to you, Sigurd.[A][N]
Be sure that he learns from this experience.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You can leave it to me, Lord Arvis.[A][N]
Once we're done here, I'll do what I[N]
can to convince him to go home.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good to hear it. Now, I must return[N]
to His Majesty's side in the capital.[A][N]
I'm entrusting this crisis to you, Sigurd.[A][X]

The master archers of House Yngvi[N]
All bear descent from Ullr.[A][N]
Our noble duke, Lord Ring, has twin[N]
daughters, as well as a son.[A][N]
But he lost one of them to pirates a[N]
long time ago, she was so young[...][A][N]
Edain is still here, but his son,[N]
Stewie, is away at the Isaach Campaign.[A][N]
Rumor has it that they don't get[N]
along well now that he is grown[...][A][X]

##Village2
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOldWoman]
The ruling family of this area[N]
has produced fine knights[A][N]
It's no surprise, the Chalphys are[N]
descendants of Baldr, a Crusader.[A][N]
If we just had Lord Byron's Tyrfing[N]
there'd be nothing to fear![A][N]
But we don't, so please take this[N]
and remember to Baldr' those bandits![A][X]

##Village3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadFemaleElder]
Oh? You came to save us![N]
I was so sure this was the end![A][N]
Take this speed ring, it's the least I[N]
can do, slip it on[A][N]
and you'll be as nimble 
as a feather![A][N]
Your enemies will be too slow[N]
to hit you![A][X]

##Village4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMaleElder]
Listen up, kid![A][N]
Swords are good against axes,[N]
axes are good against lances,[A][N]
and lances are good against swords.[A][N]
Keep that in mind when you're fighting.[N]
But there are exceptions to this rule.[A][N]
There are these special weapons,[N]
they call 'em "reavers".[A][N]
I've got an Axereaver here.[A][N]
Go on, take it, it's your[N]
reward for helping us out.[A][X]

##Village5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadOldMan]
Oh, thank the gods![A][N]
We're saved![N]
We can't thank you enough![A][N]
Here, the whole village did their[N]
bit to raise some money for you[A][N]
It's not much, but we hope it helps.[A][N]
Be sure to lend the other villages a[N]
hand too, they'll be happy to help back![A][X]

##SigurdEthlyn
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadEthlyn]
Sigurd! You are okay![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn? Its good to see you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was so worried when I heard about[N]
Verdane's invasion.[A][N]
I'm just glad[N]
you're okay.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You didn't think I'd lose to a bunch[N]
of barbarians did you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No[...]But I heard you had only a[N]
a few soldiers in Chalphy.[A][N]
and I know you, Sigurd. You are[N]
always jumping into this kind of stuff[A][N]
without thinking.[A][N]
Especially with Father being away[...]I[N]
knew I had to come[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hah! You've always had your[N]
head on straight, haven't you?[A][N]
I swear, after Mother perished, it was[N]
you who kept us in check.[A][N]
Once you went off to marry Quan,[N]
we could've sworn that Father[A][N]
finally had a lady for a daughter[...][A][N]
I feel so sorry for Quan![N]
Hahaha![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sigurd! If I'm a nag its because of[N]
you and Father![A][N]
If both of you weren't such slobs![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Heh, perhaps you're right.[N]
Listen, Ethlyn[...][A][N]
We might not act like it, but everything[N]
you've done means the world to us.[A][N]
I'm so sorry for all the trouble I've[N]
caused you, and thank you for coming.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

##QuanisWell
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadQuan]
Seems you're doing well, Sigurd.[A][N]
We heard about your skirmish with[N]
Verdane. We're here to help.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What about Leonster? Don't you have[N]
Travant to keep an eye on?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We do. That's why I only brought[N]
my apprentince, Finn.[A][N]
The entire Lance Ritter is under[N]
my father's command.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[...] I'm sorry to drag you[N]
into all of this, Quan.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sigurd! Did you already forget[N]
about our pact?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Guh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Remember the academy? We all met at[N]
the military academy back in Belhalla.[A][N]
It was the three of us. You, me,[N]
and Eldigan.[A][N]
We were talking late one night.[A][N]
And we vowed to help each other if[N]
one of us was ever in trouble.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That's right.[N]
No[...] I haven't forgotten.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Okay then.[A][N]
Let's get to work and rid yourself[N]
of this little nuisance.[A][N]
Don't forget, Sigurd. I'm always here[N]
for you. Especially in times like these[A][X]

##LittleFella
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadAzel]
Sir, I'm glad to see that you're safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Azelle!? What are you doing here[N]
all the way from Velthomer?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lex and I came to help you fight[N]
as soon as we got the word.[A][N]
Please, let us fight with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm, I could never ask you to fight.[N]
Does Lord Arvis know that you're here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, I doubt it. He's back in Belhalla[N]
commanding the Royal Guard.[A][N]
Actually, he specifically forbade me[N]
from stepping outside the capital.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Surely he did! Have you considered the[N]
consequences of leaving like you did?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah but[...] Truthfully Arvis scares me![A][N]
I don't think I live up to his[N]
expectations.[A][N]
I[...] I feel like I'm just a[N]
burden on him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, you have your reasons, I'm glad[N]

helping the Chalphys.[A][N]
I'm here by own reckoning.[A][N]
Sigurd, just so you know[...] I'm not here[N]

good friend of mine.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

##RodanTime
[OpenRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadRodan]
[OpenFarRight][LoadOifey]Sire, an envoy from His Majesty[N]
is seeking an audience with you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Sigurd, your performance in[N]
this battle was outstanding. [A]His Majesty[N]
is highly pleased, and has thus[A][N]
proclaimed your ordination as[N]
a paladin of the realm.[A][N][OpenRight]
I hardly deserve such an honor, sir![N]
I pledge my undying fealty to His Majesty.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
From here, it is imperative that you[N]
hold Evans,[A] we can ill afford to lose[N]
such a valuable defensive point to[A][N]
the enemy.[A] You and your men shall[N]
be handsomely paid for your service.[A][N]
Provided, of course, that our territory[N]
survives unscathed. Best of luck,[A][N]
Lord Sigurd. Grannvale expects[N]
every man to do his duty.[A][X]
