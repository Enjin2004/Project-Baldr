##YouCurs
[OpenMidRight][LoadMunnir]
You curs seriously haven't[N]
seized this puny castle yet?[A][N]
Useless, the lot of you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Outta my way! I'll do it myself![A][X]

##AlecEthlyn
[OpenMidRight][LoadEthlyn][OpenMidLeft][LoadAlec]
Lady Ethlyn?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alec! You're alright![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course! You're looking as lovely[N]
as ever.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Uhh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]thank you, I was worried[N]
about you guys.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You didn't think these[N]
barbarians would best ME, did you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You can never be too careful.[N]
is Sigurd safe?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, m'lady, Sigurd is[N]
just fine.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank goodness, We came as soon as we[N]
got the news, Quan and I are here[A][N]
to help.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lady Ethlyn, your good spirit knows[N]
no bounds![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I couldn't sleep if I knew[N]
everyone back in Chalphy was in[A][N]
danger,[A] Sigurd is my brother, but you[N]
Noish and Arden, You guys[A][N]
are like family too![A][N]
I just couldn't leave you out[N]
here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It makes me happy to hear you say that.[N]
but m'lady, these barbarians are savages.[A][N]
Your sword looks weak, too, Here, Take my[N]
spare, I don't want you getting hurt.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you Alec, I'll be sure to[N]
use it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
And stay away from danger if[N]
you can! I don't want to see that[A][N]
pretty face scratched up.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, Alec[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]some things never change[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##SorryAideen
[OpenMidRight][LoadAideen][OpenMidLeft][LoadMidir]
Milady, The castle's completely[N]
surrounded! We've failed you miserably![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Midir, it's alright, Everyone gave his best.[N]
You needn't worry about me any longer.[A][N]
Please save yourself, I want as many[N]
of you to get out of this alive as possible![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We aren't going anywhere, milady.[N]
We're here for you till the very end[A][N]
Even if it means our lives![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]thank you, Midir, I'm so sorry to[N]
put you through all this.[A][X]

##ChalphyDudes
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNoish][OpenRight][LoadSigurd]
Munnir's army already has Jungby[N]
surrounded, Aideen is in grave danger![A][N]
Noish, I'm going to help her, I'm leaving[N]
Chalphy in your hands.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hold, milord, Surely you don't[N]
intend to go alone?[A][N][OpenRight]
Nearly all of our forces are[N]
already on the march to Isaach[A][N]
with Father, there's hardly anybody[N]
left to call upon, they may be simple[A][N]
savages, but Verdane's army is still huge.[N]
I can't risk your lives by forcing[A][N]
you to face them.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Perish the thought, milord![A][N]
I was born a knight, and I will[N]
gladly risk dying a knight's death[A][N]
in your name, To allow our lord[N]
to die alone in battle would be[A][N]
an unspeakable disgrace, We shall[N]
be by your side, every step of the way.[A][N]
Alec, I trust you're of the same mind?[A][N][OpenLeft][LoadAlec]
Yeah, of course! But there's more[N]
than just Jungby at stake, We've[A][N]
got to stop by the nearby villages first.[N]
Those thugs'll try to beat us to them[A][N]
and they'll loot, massacre, and burn them[N]
all down if they do, We've gotta get there[A][N]
first, and lend the locals a hand in[N]
locking the villages down[A][N]
and fortifying their defenses[A][N][OpenRight]
Absolutely, We mustn't neglect[N]
our knightly duties to the people[A][N]
especially not at a time like this.[N]
Good point, Alec.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Actually, that was all Oifey's idea.[A][N]
That kid's every bit the tactician[N]
they say he is, Give him a few years[A][N]
and he'll be a match for his old grandpa,[N]
Lord Sesar![A][N][OpenRight]
Oifey's still around the castle,[N]
Huh...Oifey! I know you're here.[A][N]
You can come out now![A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadOifey]My apologies for still being here, sire.[A][N]
Still, If you would allow it, I'd like to[N]
join you in battle, I can't just sit back[A][N]
while you risk your lives[A][N][OpenRight]
I don't know...You're still so young.[N]
Are you sure you're ready for this.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I'm already fourteen, sire, I may not[N]
be battle ready just yet, but there's[A][N]
still so much I can do to support you.[N]
Please, allow me to accompany you.[A][N]
I swear I won't let you down.[A][N][OpenRight]
Fair enough, Oifey, After all[N]
you've already spent two years[A][N]
training as my squire, Real Battlefield[N]
experience would be fantastic for[A][N]
your training, but you're still definitely[N]
not up to actual combat duty for now.[A][N]
How about you ride with me[N]
as my advisor instead[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Y-yes! Thank you, sire! Thank you![A][N][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadNoish]Milord, what of the defense of Chalphy[N]
itself in our absence? Leaving the castle[A][N]
unattended is risky, Should the enemy[N]
slip past us, an unguarded castle will fall[A][N]
easily and spell us a swift end[A][N][OpenLeft]
Noish, I'd say there's only one man[N]
who we can depend upon for that[A][N]
...Eh, Arden?[A][N][OpenFarRight][LoadArden]
Hold on a moment! Why me, Alec?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Sturdy as a brick wall! Strong as an ox![N]
Slow as a turtle! Face it, Arden,[A][N]
you were born for guard duty! Haha![A][N][OpenFarRight]
Pah...I'm strong and tough, I know,[N]
but you really don't need to call me slow![A][N][OpenRight]
He has a point, Arden, Would you?[N]
You're the most apt at guard duty.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Sigh...Fine, I'll do it, But you have to[N]
bring me with you at least once![A][N]
I don't want to be left out of the action.[A][N][OpenRight]
Right, Men, it's time to set out.[A][N]
Let's start by assisting the villages,[N]
and then it's onward to Jungby![A][X]

##MunnirRektsMidir

Er, yes, sir...[A][N][OpenLeft]
Hah, relax! Won't be long, and i'll be[N]
bringing Kinbois' lot along for the fun.[A][N]
When I do, All Grannvale's our oyster.[A][N]
Even Belhalla ought to be easy pickings,[N]
what with nobody around to stop us![A][N]
The kingdom's all ours, boys![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Leave it to us, sir![A][X]

##Dawdling

Who's that there dame you have?[A][N][OpenRight]
The spoils of war, m'boy! She's[N]
coming back to Marpha to marry me.[A][N]
Whaddya think? a real keeper, eh?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll say! Just looking at her's[N]
makin' me mouth water.[A][N][OpenRight]

You'll have your pick of all Grannvale[N]
once we're done here, Keep it in your[A][N]
pants a little longer, yeah?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
What animals...Gods above,[N]
I implore you, bestow upon these[A][N]
men a hint of human decency...[A][N][OpenRight]

##RodanTime
[OpenRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadRodan]
[OpenFarRight][LoadOifey]Sire, an envoy from His Majesty[N]
is seeking an audience with you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Sigurd, your performance in[N]
this battle was outstanding,[A]His Majesty[N]
is highly pleased, and has thus[A][N]
proclaimed your ordination as[N]
a paladin of the realm.[A][N][OpenRight]
I hardly deserve such an honor, sir![N]
I pledge my undying fealty to His Majesty.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
From here, it is imperative that you[N]
hold Evans,[A] we can ill afford to lose[N]
such a valuable defensive point to[A][N]
the enemy,[A] You and your men shall[N]
be handsomely paid for your service.[A][N]
Provided, of course, that our territory[N]
survives unscathed, Best of luck,[A][N]
Lord Sigurd, Grannvale expects[N]
every man to do his duty.[A][X]
