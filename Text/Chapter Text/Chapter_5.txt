Milord, we've sighted the fugitive Duke Byron.[N]
We caught him resting, but he slipped away.[A][N]
It seems as if he plans to escape to Silesse.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?! You simpleton![N]
Get out there and hunt him down, immediately![A][N]
My ambush may have put an end to Chalphy's[N]
paladin brigade, the Grünenritter, but the survival[A][N]
of Byron alone leaves that utterly meaningless![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes, sir[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But you see, milord, Byron is still gravely wounded.[N]
Surely, he has very little time left[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I've never heard such naïve drivel![A][N]
Byron may not be long for this world,[N]
but he's determined to get that sword, Tyrfing,[A][N]
to his son with the very last of his strength.[A][N]
Do you not understand the threat that Sigurd[N]
would pose to us, should he get his hands on[A][N]
that damnable sword?[A][N]
Move out and kill Byron, immediately![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Y-yes, sir![N]

For the gods' sakes, he's leading the elite[N]
Grauenritter brigade! How could it take him so[A][N]
long to put down that Isaachian resistance?![A][N]
First Lex, and now Dannan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Why must both of my sons be so worthless?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Come now, Lord Lombard, sir![A][N]
Don't worry about a thing. After all,[N]
you've still got the Beigenritter and I on your side.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose you're right, Andrey.[A][N]
Be sure that your men are ready to join[N]

Hm?[N]
Is he an enemy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't believe so.[A][N]
The Lubeck occupation seems to be pursuing him,[N]
so they're most likely not with them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see. Let's give them a hand.[A][N]
We'll be clashing with Lombard's army sooner[N]

Is something wrong, Brigid?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, Edain. You heard what Andrey's been up[N]
to lately, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I did. I've heard of how he murdered our father,[N]
and later Annand in Silesse as well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I can barely imagine the evil which would have[N]
possessed him to do such monstrous things.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm going to kill Andrey. There's no other way.[N]
Whatever the evil is, he has to be stoppped.[A][N]
Right here, right now.[A][N]
You get what I'm saying, right, Edain?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Brigid[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Andrey's crimes are House Yngvi's crimes.[A][N]
They're our crimes, too. They reflect badly[N]
on us, even though they really shouldn't.[A][N]
I know I'll have his blood on my hands[N]

This is the end, Edain.[N]
Our final battle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I have a little gift for you.[N]
Here. Use this to aid our young comrades.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This is a Rescue staff, is it not?[N]
Thank you, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] why me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I've yet to speak even a word of this[N]
to anyone, but as my wife[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You should know.[N]
Listen well, Edain. We cannot prevail.[A][N]
This war will end today with our defeat.[N]
Everything we hold dear will be lost.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I beg your pardon?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Such is the decree of the gods I received[N]
at the Tower of Bragi.[A][N]
I, too, struggled to accept it at first.[N]
However, this is our fate. It is inevitable.[A][N]
I know I am destined to die in this battle.[N]
Thus, I entrust you with this staff.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You must be lying![N]
I cannot believe any of it![A][N]
I cannot![A][N]
Please[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Please![N]
Tell me this is just a cruel joke[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Edain, there is no reason to grieve.[A][N]
Our deaths are not the end,[N]
but rather a new beginning for us all.[A][N]
Life is fated to fade into death, and with it,[N]
so too does mortal form die.[A][N]
And yet, never shall life fade into total[N]
nothingness.[A][N]
Death is but the herald for the next step[N]
to a perfect state of being.[A][N]
It holds no fear for mankind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
But, Claud[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even as I greet death, a rebirth awaits.[A][N]
Why, look no further than yourself for proof![A][N]
Within you grows a new life just waiting[N]
to be born, and I too am part of it.[A][N]
This, Edain, is why you must live on.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Do you realize what you're saying, Claud?![A][N]
Asking me to live on while you accept your death[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It isn't fair[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Edain[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I am richly blessed to have known you[N]
and been your husband, even so briefly.[A][N]
Please, forgive me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]

##ArvisGaslighting
[OpenMidRight][LoadArvis][OpenMidLeft][LoadAzmur]
Lord Arvis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Are Sigurd and his party truly on the march[N]
to our holy capital?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed, but we've no cause for alarm. Duke[N]
Lombard and his army stands ready at Lubeck.[A][N]
It is only a matter of time before their[N]
insurrection is suppressed.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Even now, it is almost beyond belief, is it not?[A][N]
That Lord Byron would slay Kurth[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Or that Sigurd would incite a rebellion[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your Majesty, if I may explain once more[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Lord Byron was plotting against the crown[N]
in concert with the late Lord Ring of Yngvi.[A][N]
His Highness fell afoul of their assault,[A][N]
an act to which our very own Dukes Reptor[N]
and Lombard bore witness.[A][N]
His Highness learned of their schemes[N]
to seize the throne from the royal family too late,[N]
and paid for it with his life.[A][N]
Naturally, Lord Sigurd had a hand in his father's[N]
revolt.[A][N]
What clearer proof is there than how he still[N]
harbors an enemy, the Isaachian prince?[A][N]
There is no question.[N]
Their treason against the state is grave.[A][N]
I, too, feel this pain as my own, having lost[N]
not onnly a prince but a father-in-law[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And in the name of my beloved wife,[N]
Princess Deirdre,[A][N]
I will never allow Sigurd's traitorous[N]
rampage to stand![A][N]
Even if Duke Lombard fails to defeat him,[N]
that is not the end![A][N]
The elite mages of House Velthomer,[N]
the Rotenritter,[N]
stand ready to suppress this rebellion,[N]
once and for all![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] If you say it is so, then perhaps[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Perhaps this could never have been avoided[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Arvis, about[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Cough![A][N]
About Deirdre[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][LoadArvis][OpenRight][LoadDeirdre]
Oh, Grandfather! Are you sure you feel all right?[A][N]
Please, you mustn't strain yourself![N]
Come, lie down.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Deirdre. Bless you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You truly are a sweet child.[A][N]
Even if I have little time left,[N]
you give me hope for Grannvale's future[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I can scarcely imagine when Kurth[N]
would have had as fine a daughter as you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But there is no doubt in my mind.[A][N]
None outside the royal House Belhalla[N]
possess the same brand that graces your brow.[A][N]
Whence did you come, my dear?[N]
Where in the world have you been all along[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
I'm so sorry, Grandfather[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I simply don't remember.[A][N]
Try as I may,[N]
I cannot recall even a single thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, forgive me, my dear[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I know you have suffered more and longer[N]
than any of us.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
From the moment I found her lost[N]
in the castle grounds,[A][N]
it was clear she had no memory[N]
of her past.[A][N]
All she knew was her own name.[N]
The rest of her past is lost to her.[A][N]
At first I sought only to aid her out of sympathy,[N]
as any decent man would do,[A][N]
but before long love took root within me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
With all due respect, Deirdre,[A][N]
not once did I suspect that you could possibly[N]
be the daughter of our late Prince Kurth.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I remember well the day you introduced her[N]
as the woman you wished to marry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I simply could not believe what I saw![N]
At first sight[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I knew, perhaps as only family can.[A][N]
Precisely as I thought, beneath your circlet lies[N]
the Brand of Naga.[A][N]
Lord Arvis, I trust you understand.[A][N]
Only a full-blooded heir to Saint Heim[N]
can rightfully wield the Book of Naga[A][N]
and release its true holy power.[A][N]
And the power of Naga is the only power[N]
able to oppose the dark lord, Loptous.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
I am well aware of the legend, sire.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The holy lineage of our lord Naga and Saint Heim[N]
must never perish![A][N]
Deirdre[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You must bear a son with all due haste![A][N]
And should your son be so fortunate[N]
as to inherit Naga's power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
He shall be the Prince of Grannvale,[N]
and shall claim the throne once I am no more.[A][N]
Lord Arvis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] until your son has grown into a man,[N]
you shall be his regent.[A][N]
Guide him well to adulthood.[A][N]
I trust you understand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

Listen, Oifey, I need to ask something of you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course, sire.[N]
What is it?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I recall, the territory of Isaach should be[N]
very close to the north-east of Lubeck.[A][N]
From what I've heard, ever since Grannvale[N]
won the war,[A][N]
Isaach has been governed by Dannan,[N]

But I'd wager his influence has yet to reach[N]

I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I don't want to lose Seliph.[A][N]

Calm down, Shannan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]

but this isn't helping.[A][N]
It's okay. He'll be fine with Oifey.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]

And you're forgetting that the people of Isaach[N]
won't exactly be happy to see more Grannvaleans![A][N]
Oifey alone won't last a minute there,[N]
but if I'm here it'll be okay.[A][N]
Who better to protect Seliph in Isaach[N]
than the prince of Isaach himself?[A][N]

Now that he mentions it, sire,[A][N]
I would be a tad more at ease[N]
if Shannan was there as well.[A][N]
I know you're reluctant to involve one as young[N]

He no longer needs my protection.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Once I've seen this war through,[N]

Until then, Sigurd, I won't run away.[N]
For better or worse, I'm with you.[A][X]

Geez, Azelle, you look awful![N]
What's going on?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, Lex[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Why are you looking so happy?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh? Oh, right.[N]
My dad[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Mm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm gonna be honest, Azelle.[A][N]
It's not that I feel nothing at all about[N]
what happened. Can't be helped, right?[A][N]
But after all the pain and suffering Dad caused[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, he deserved to go down.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You know,[N]
I've always admired you for your resilience, Lex.[A][N]
Just thinking about my brother is ebough[N]
to make me tremble.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, Arvis has always struck me as quite an[N]
odd one, but he's always been a decent fellow.[A][N]
I still can't see him as our enemy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Arvis has always been like a father to me,[N]
and I never knew my real father.[A][N]
The problem is, sometimes he just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
He just changes![A][N]
It's as if he becomes a whole different man.[N]
That's why I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's why you up and left him behind at home,[N]
right?[A][N]
There's nothing wrong with that, Azelle.[N]
He's got his life, and you've got yours.[A][N]
Don't beat yourself up about it, okay?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

What's goin' on here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, er, sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're right.[A][N]

##LeonsterArmyIsHere
[OpenMidRight][LoadQuan]
Gentlemen, we've not much further to go.[N]
Keep giving it your best.[A][N]
Rumor has it that Sigurd's army should be[N]
moving south through the Aed Desert.[A][N]
If we keep this pace north, we should be[N]
able to rendezvous with them sooner or later.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadEthlyn]
Quan, I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.[A][N]
You and your father were too generous[N]
sparing so many soldiers to help my brother,[A][N]
even though your father is presently so ill[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But are you sure you're both willing to risk[N]
crossing a nation as all-powerful as Grannvale?[A][N]
The very thought is terrifying[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn, you know as well as I that Leonster,[N]
a nation built on the legacy of the Crusader Njorun,[A][N]
is far stronger than its size suggests.[A][N]
No matter what happens, I could never regret[N]
giving my all for a cause as just as Sigurd's.[A][N]
My father feels precisely the same way.[A][N]
There's nothing to worry about, Ethlyn.[N]
After all, I'm wielding none other than Gae Bolg![A][N]
I'll never fail with it at my side![N]
Sigurd could certainly stand to have my aid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I suppose you're right.[N]
He'd appreciate any help at this point[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn, we'll be entering hostile territory[N]
very shortly.[A][N]
The enemy could ambush us at any moment, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Actually, Quan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've been thinking this over quite a bit,[N]
and I'm coming with you after all.[A][N]
I'd like to see my brother again,[N]
and I simply can't abandon you now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't allow that![A][N]
I let you come wiwth me solely because[N]
you promised to return home partway.[A][N]
To say nothing of Altena's presence![A][N]
Look at her, a mere babe of three years[N]
curled up aslumber in her mother's lap.[A][N]
Should we be attacked, what then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Why, I'd fight my hardest to protect her.[N]
Nobody could possibly seize her from me![A][N]
I certainly never intended at first to take her[N]
with us.[A][N]
But she simply wouldn't stop crying[N]
when I tried to leave her behind.[A][N]
You're right, though[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You're right. I'll take her home.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn, I'm sorry.[A][N]
I assure you I do know precisely how you feel,[N]
but Leif is barely born and waiting for you at home.[A][N]
Our children need their mother. Please, Ethlyn.[N]
Return home. I left Finn to defend the capital.[A][N]
You'll be safe with him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'd like just a little more time.[N]
I want to stay by your side a little longer.[A][N]
Please, Quan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Very well. We've a little more time to spare.[A][X]

we're tailing him. And there's a woman with him?[ToggleSmile][A][N]
What a clumsy mistake.[A][N]
Why, I daresay, this is the long-awaited end[N]
of Leonster's famous Lanzenritter![A][N]
Those hooves'll be sinking clean into the sand.[N]
They can't so much as flail at us.[A][N]

##Ambush
[OpenMidRight][LoadQuan]

No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You cannot be serious![A][N]

Ethlyn, run![N]
We've no hope of victory in this blasted desert![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what will you do?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They're like wild hyenas, Ethlyn![A][N]
Children are little more than easy targets[N]
for them![A][N]
Thracia has sought to reconquer our territory[N]
for centuries.[A][N]
I thought my absence would be taken as an invitation,[N]
so I left Finn behind with half the army in case[A][N]
they made the obvious move.[A][N]
Not once[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Not even once did I ever suspect they would[N]
pursue US instead![A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
This was all a mistake[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You can't give up now, Quan! It'll be okay.[N]
We're together, aren't we?[A][N]
At the very least, together we'll not[N]
go down easily![A][N][OpenMidRight]

##VelthomerScheme
[OpenMidRight][LoadReptor][OpenMidLeft][LoadArvis]
I see. Duke Lombard fell in battle[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
A-Arvis![N]
What are we supposed to do now?![A][N]
It was you who insisted that, even if we left the[N]
bulk of our armies on conquests with our sons,[A][N]
Sigurd would pose no threat to me at all![A][N]
The situation before us is not the outcome[N]
you promised me![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Reptor, your overreaction is baseless.[N]
The deck is still stacked in our favor.[A][N]
The Velthomer army is already lying in wait[N]
for the rebels in the Aed Desert's depths.[A][N]
Furthermore, Thracian sellswords should be[N]
arriving to reinforce us at any moment.[A][N]
The enemy will assuredly be exhausted.[A][N]
So long as my army and yours cooperate,[N]
Sigurd and his rebels ought to fall with ease.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm holding you to your word this time, Arvis.[A][N]
Remember, I've no objection to you alone[N]
claiming the throne once Azmur finally dies.[A][N]
But don't you dare forget your allies[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Must I remind you?[A][N]
The instant the dust of this war settles, House Friege[N]
will be granted the Agustrian throne to govern.[A][N]
House Dozel, meanwhile, will be entrusted[N]
with the rule of Isaach. Rest assured, Reptor.[A][N]
I will honor your rights to these territories.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hrm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Very well.[N]
Then I, too, will fight with all I have[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][LoadManfroy]
Kehehehehe[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][N]
Greetings, Lord Arvis.[A][N]
The plan proceeds precisely on time, I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Manfroy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You must not show your face here.[A][N]
Until  the Grannvale throne is mine, I cannot allow[N]
you or your brethren to appear in public.[A][N]
Do you not understand?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, we understand.[ToggleSmile][A][N]
We understand how you indulge the greed[N]
of men as vile as Reptor and Lombard.[A][N]
We understand how even then, you still will not[N]
concede the very fact of our existence.[A][N]
The plan was to use those two buffoons until they[N]
could be used no further,[A][N]
then cast them aside and use their sons instead[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Was it not?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Hear me well, Manfroy.[A][N]
I refuse to have any part in the revival of your[N]
Loptrian Empire.[A][N]
I've no desire to oppress your cult,[N]
but I've even less desire to consign[A][N]
the world to your dark lord's rule.[N]
Remember this well.[A][N]
Yes, the blood of Loptous's scions flows in my[N]
veins, but there is so much more to me than that.[A][N]
My Loptrian heritage is that of Saint Maera,[N]
a man who fought for the rights of people.[A][N]
And more importantly, I am the one true heir[N]
of the Crusader Fjalar, Loptous's sworn enemy.[A][N]
I will change this world for the better.[A][N]
Under my rule, humanity shall be free from[N]
the pain of prejudice, tyranny and oppression![A][N]
What a pity it is, that Sigurd must die,[N]
but alas, all things require sacrifice.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ohohoho[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][N]
A sacrifice for the sake of the Lady Deirdre,[N]
you mean. You are terrified, Lord Arvis.[ToggleSmile][A][N]
You fear her memory may someday return[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't you dare bring her into this![N]
Need I remind you? We. Are. In. LOVE![A][N]
Nothing will ever come between us![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Heh heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][N]
I suppose you two need to hasten and[N]
make proof of this love of yours.[A][N]

to be a most magnificent king![A][N]

at such a young age.[A][N]
Do you not care for Ares's safety as well?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course I do! But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Oh, never mind.[N]

I hope the children are okay back in Silesse.[N]

Heh.[ToggleSmile][A][N]
It's a shame you can't ride my pegasus with me,[N]

Please.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course![A][N]
I can't exactly go dying now that I've got a lass[N]
as lovely as you to support, can I?[A][N]
Maybe once this war's done, when we go back[N]
to Silesse we could quit fighting for a change[A][N]
and start ourselves a little shop![A][N]

Look, all of House Friege is out there doing[N]

Ah, Lord Sigurd.[N]
I'm glad to see you're safe.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's going on?[N]
What's caused Velthomer's change of loyalties?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Arvis has long been aware of[N]
your innocence, and was on your side all along.[A][N]
This affair in its entirety was dictated[N]
by the whims of Reptor and Lombard,[A][N]
architects of the conspiracy against you.[N]
Lord Arvis was unable to act until now,[A][N]
as the dukes' control of the royal court[N]
was simply too powerful to contravene.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
All' well that ends well, then.[A][N]
I can restore my father's good name[N]

Quite the magnificent celebration of[N]
your glorious return is in order today, it seems.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

this ought to be a fitting conclusion.[A][N]
Once we're done I should look into getting[N]

Ah, Lord Sigurd.[N]
Truly this is quite the auspicious day.[A][N]
Congratulations on your triumphant return[N]
to the fatherland![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's good to see you too, Lord Arvis,[N]
and thank you for such a lavish greeting![A][N]
If I may ask, where is His Majesty?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alas, His Majesty is taken severely ill.[N]
He has become permanently bedridden.[A][N]
As such, I am administering all affairs of state[N]
on his behalf for the time being.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so?[N]
I'm sorry to hear that.[A][N]
I bet my misadventures didn't exactly help[N]
His Majesty feel any better![ToggleSmile][A][N]
Once we're finished here, I should visit the[N]
palace and give him my sincerest apologies.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I think not.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Hm?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[THREATENING MUSIC BEGIN TO PLAY]
Sigurd of Chalphy, I hereby sentence you to death[N]
for your crimes of treason.[A][N]
His Majesty will not be seeing you, today or ever.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
W-what?![N]
What are you talking about, Lord Arvis?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You are only realizing now?[ToggleSmile][N]
You are far too naive, Sigurd.[A][N]
Need I remind you that you and your father[N]
still sought to usurp the throne and plotted[A][N]
against the crown?[N]
Nothing has changed.[A][N]
It is my duty to exact justice upon you,[N]
in the name of my wife, Princess Deirdre.[A][N]
I trust you understand, Sigurd.[A][N][OpenMidRight
P-Princess Deirdre?!
That[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, it can't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, of course.[N]
You've never met, correct?[A][N]
Very well. I suppose an introduction would be[N]
a fair parting gift before your demise.[A][N]
Come, Deirdre![N]
Greet our guest![A][X]

##Sadness
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenFarLeft][LoadDeirdre][OpenLeft][LoadArvis]
Deirdre, allow me to introduce you to Sigurd:[N]
the spawn of your father's murderer, Byron.[A][N]
I trust you have some choice words for him?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
So[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] So this is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Sir Sigurd?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Deirdre?![N]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This can't be happening[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Why[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Why are you speaking like this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Deirdre! It really is you![N]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] No, no, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Do you know me, sir?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
OF COURSE I DO![ToggleSmile][N]
YOU'RE MY-[A][N][OpenLeft]
Enough![N]
Deirdre, stand clear.[A][N]
This is an extremely dangerous man.[N]
Rest assured: this traitor will be punished.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] He's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Can't we have even a little more time?[A][N][OpenLeft]
Unacceptable. Guards![N]
Escort the princess to the castle![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Wait! Arvis, please![N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Just a little more time[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadArvis][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
W-wait! DEIRDRE![N]
Arvis, please! I beg of you![A][N]
She's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] She's my[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Enough![N]
I grow weary of your ravings.[A][N]
Attention, men! We no longer have any use[N]
for keeping the traitors alive.[A][N]
Move in on Sigurd and his party![A][N]
The time to serve them their punishment[N]
has come![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]D[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] DAMN YOU, ARVIS!![A][X]

on the battlefield...[A][N]
Was their sacrifice in vain?[N]
What were they fighting for all along?[A][N]
And what of the light...?[A][X]
