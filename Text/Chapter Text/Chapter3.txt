Ayra![N]
Hey there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What do you want, Lex?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Sheesh![N]
Courteous as ever, aren't you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look, get to your point, whatever it may be.[N]
I've better things to do than waste my time on you. [A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hold on.[N]
I've got a little gift here.[A][N]
I thought of you the moment I saw it.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You can foist it on other woman.[N]
I've no use for such trinkets.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Not even something like this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh?[N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wit![A][N]
That's-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, good![A][N]
You're well acquainted with the famous[N]
brave sword, then.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I never thought I'd see a real brave sword![N]
Never have I seen a blade so beautiful[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Glad you like it![N]
It's yours.[A][N]
I guess I'll see you around, Ayra.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er, Lex![N]

Hey, Ayra![N]
This is for you.[A][N]
Here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Isn't this a brave sword?[N]
Why me, though?[A][N]
Shouldn't you be wielding this yourself?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This thing is only gonna get harder from here,[N]
yeah? You burn through blades so fast, [A][N]
you could do with a spare or two.[A][N]
Look after yourself out here, okay?[N]
One day I might not be here to watch your back.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Chulainn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Thank you.[A][N]
I promise I'll put it to good use.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadEldigan][OpenMidLeft][LoadLachesis]
Brother, stop![N]
It's me, Lachesis![A][N]
This pointlessness has gone on long enough![A][N]
Your actions are utterly baffling![N]
Would you really betray Sigurd, your friend?[A][N]
Is this what you call a knight's pride?![A][N]
Please, brother! Believe in Sigurd.[A][N]
Give him even the tiniest amount more time[N]
to finish his job. We don't need to fight.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lachesis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Look, don't cry.[N]
Fighting is my only choice.[A][N]
Please don't make this harder than it already is.[A][N]
His Majesty's death will spell the death[N]
of Agustria, too, and I cannot allow that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That isn't true![N]
Everything hinges on Chagall laying down his arms.[A][N]
Sigurd never had any interest in fighting,[N]
and has even less interest in continuing if you stop.[A][N]
Brother[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Please.[N]
You lead the Cross Knights![A][N]
Chagall simply cannot ignore your counsel![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] You're right, Lachesis.[N]
I'll try and persuade His Majesty, one more time.[A][N]
If I must risk my life, I'd rather risk it to stop[N]
this blasted war than to fight my friend.[A][N]
Any knight would do the same.[A][N]
Lachesis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Here.[N]
This sword is for you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Isn't this the Lands Sword?![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Brother, you can't be-[N][OpenMidRight]
This is a last memento, in case I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm sorry, Lachesis.
You must survive![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
W-wait![N]
Stop! Don't go, Eldigan![A][X]

Eldigan, please![N]
Lay down your sword![A][N]
I don't want to fight you![A][N]
I still have every intention of returning[N]
Agusty to Chagall![A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sigurd.[N]
I'm sorry, but I grow weary of these excuses.[A][N]
We stand now as two knights on the battlefield,[N]
sworn to an honorable duel.[A][N]
Draw, Sigurd![N]
So long as I wield the demon blade, Mystletainn,[A][N]
I won't be the one to fall this day![A][X]

W[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Why did this happen?[N]
Why couldn't we save Eldigan?![A][N]
Has this damned war been[N]
in vain after all along[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry, sire, but there was nothing you could[N]
have done. I know it hurts, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
For now, the best we can do is work to realize[N]
Eldigan's wishes,[A][N]
and give the Agustrian people[N]
the peace they deserve.[A][X]

Your Majesty, please order a retreat![N]
There's no use in continuing this fight.[A][N]
Agusty shall be returned to Your Majesty[N]
someday, but it must happen peacefully.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eldigan! How dare you abandon the battle[N]
to spout such nonsense![A][N]
You couldn't hide your true colors forever, traitor![A][N]
Men! Seize this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] this worm!
Off with his head! Humiliate him![A][N]
Parade his shamebefore the world![A][N][OpenMidLeft]

This spells Agustria's doom-[N][OpenMidRight]
