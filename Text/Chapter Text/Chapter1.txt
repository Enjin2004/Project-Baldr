You're doing a fine job, soldier.[N]
I leave the border's defenses to you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, milord![A][X]

##EldiganEvans
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadEldigan]
Sigurd![N]
It's been a long time.[A][N]
Pray tell, why do I find you suddenly occupying[N]
Evans?[A][N]
You couldn't possibly be declaring war[N]
on Verdane, could you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eldigan![N]
Am I glad to see you.[A][N]
Listen. The Verdanites have abducted[N]
Lady Edain of Yngvi.[A][N]
They've made it amply clear that they[N]
don't plan on releasing her.[A][N]
Taking her back by force is our only option.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, I see.[N]
That makes sense.[A][N]
Well, whatever you do,[N]
you cannot afford to leave Evans unattended.[A][N]
My fellow Agustrian lords have been of a[N]
rancorous sort of late[...][A][N]
Ah, I know.[N]
I'll ensure they don't threaten you from behind.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry to involve you in this as well.[A][N]
Say, Eldigan, once I'm done here,[N]
what do you say to a catch up?[A][N]
You, me, a fine bottle of wine[...][N]
Just like old times.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm. I'm looking forward to it.[N]
I trust I'll see you later, then.[A][N]
May luck be with you this day, Sigurd![A][X]

Sigurd, Quan[...] It's been too[N]
long, how have you been?[A][N][OpenRight]
Eldigan, thanks for coming![A][N][OpenFarRight]
You're right, Eldigan, it[N]
has been far too long.[A][N]
When was the last time[N]
all three of us gathered?[A][N]
Wasn't it your coronation?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah yes[...] that was a fun day, but[N]
Quan, we have some things to discuss[A][N]
Sigurd![A][N]
Pray tell, why do I find you suddenly occupying[N]

what do you say to a catch up?[A][N]
Let's meet up when this is all[N]
over. Just the three of us.[A][N]
We'll find a cozy little spot,[N]
have a little wine[...][A][N]
Just like old times.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm. I'm looking forward to it.[N]
I trust I'll see you two later, then.[A][N]
May luck be with you both this day![A][X]

Look, Cimbaeth, you have my word.[A][N]
So long as you leave Shannan alone,[N]
you'll have no trouble.[A][N]
But I do wonder if, once this battle is over,[N]
you actually plan to return him to me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Ahahahaha![A][N]
You got nothing to worry about.[N]
If we get Evans back, you get him back.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I understand.[A][N]
But be warned, Cimbaeth:[A][N]
if you break your[N]

Cross me, and I will pursue you to the very[N]

Wh-whoa, settle down there![N]

Such a cute face, but you only use it[N]
to spew bile like that![A][N]
I'm not about to make an enemy outta someone[N]
with a sword arm as fine as yours.[A][N]
I can promise you that.[A][N][OpenFarLeft][OpenMidRight]
Shannan, sit tight.[N]
Be patient for just a bit longer.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]

##ArdenAlecTalk
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAlec][OpenMidRight][LoadArden]
I was a little concerned[N]
about crossing the border[A][N]
into Verdane with most of[N]
our troops away in Isaach,[A][N]
but we've done well.[N]
At least, I think so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The quality of the soldiers[N]
we're fighting matters.[A][N]
These Verdanian thugs are barely[N]
more than common bandits.[A][N]
Still, we were lucky to rescue Edain[N]
before Munnir could do any harm to her.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah. Such a pretty lass.[A][N]
Wouldn't have been right[N]
if she'd had to marry that wretch.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You eyeing her for yourself, big guy?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What!? No! I was just saying[...][N]
But.. do you think she would?[A][N]
I'm not anyone special.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Class doesn't stop the heart from loving.[N]
Lot of girls like big strong men.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Uh[...] yeah....[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Listen, I got something I want to say.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I was wrong about a few things.[A][N]
I thought you coming along with[N]
us would slow us down,[A][N]
you being on foot while[N]
most of us are horseback.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Shucks. That means a lot.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I give you a lot of grief,[N]
but I don't mean any of it.[A][N]
You're a good soldier[N]
and a good friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

put in the metal.[A][N]

Pardon me, Prince Jamke,[N]
but are you not joining us?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No. I won't stand for my brothers' vile ways[N]

I'm going back to the capital.[A][N]
I'm going to try, one more time,[N]

You're right[...] We must do all we can[N]

Dew, you're a thief. You got caught in the act.[N]
Any tongue rippings you get are your own fault.[A][N]
If Edain hadn't insisted on letting you go too,[N]

You're not one of Cimbaeth's lot[...] Are you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We've dealt with Cimbaeth.[N]
There's nothing to be afraid of anymore.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Oh! So Ayra doesn't have to keep fighting![A][N]
My auntie Ayra was forced to fight[N]

Please! You've got to help her![A][N][OpenMidRight]
That swordswoman?[A][N]
Huh. I thought there was something amiss[N]

Very well![N]
I'll let her know that you're safe.[A][N]
Now, what's your name?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Shannan.[N]

Isaach's prince, you say[...][A][N]
I can barely begin to imagine what you've[N]

For now, though, you're welcome[N]

Don't worry.[N]
One day, you'll make it home.[A][N]
I'll do all I can to ensure that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Pardon me, sire,[N]

Prince Shannan is safe with us![A][N]
You needn't keep fighting.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What? You saved Shannan?[N]
Do you speak the truth?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I do. Prince Shannan told me everything:[A][N]
that you're the daughter[N]
of the late Isaachian king.[A][N]
Listen. You detest Grannvalians.[N]
You've made your hostility perfectly clear.[A][N]
But you can't neglect[N]
your duty to the prince.[A][N]
You can't afford to waste your life now,[N]
not on a battle senseless as this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My brother, the crown[N]
prince, entrusted Shannan[A][N]
to my care knowing that[N]
his death was inevitable.[A][N]
You're right. After all this time,[N]
I refuse to die for Verdane's sake.[A][N]
Until I've seen Shannan[N]
rise to the Isaachian throne,[A][N]
my life is not mine[N]
to forfeit to such dogs.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I will aid you all I can, if you lower your sword.[A][N]
On my honor as the heir of Baldr the Crusader,[N]
I swear I will not betray you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. I'll place my trust in you, as well[...][N]
Such is the way of the warriors of Isaach.[A][N]
For now, I pledge my blade in your service.[A][N]
However, this does not change that Grannvale[N]
is my foe.[A][N]
Beware, for if one day that includes you[...][N]
I will not hesitate.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm, war can be truly cruel.[A][N]

Please accept my apologies. I've put the people[N]

Don't worry about it.[N]
Everyone will be glad to know you're safe.[A][N]
You've got nothing to worry about anymore.[A][N]
The road back to Yngvi is secure for you,[N]

No, I wish to remain here.[N]
Injuries are inevitable in war.[A][N]
As a humble servant to the gods, it is my duty[N]
to stay here and aid your wounded.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Say, Edain[...], As I recall,[A][N]
you declined to pursue a knighthood and[N]
instead joined the clergy. Am I right?[A][N]
I shouldn't be surprised, knowing how easily[N]
people warm to you, and you to them.[A][N]
I'd do well to learn from your example.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, Lord Sigurd,[N]
but that isn't exactly true.[A][N]
Initially, I sought priesthood in a bid[N]
to help me find my sister.[A][N]
Even now, I still believe[N]
this is the answer I seek.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You mean Brigid[...][N]
I'd heard that she went missing as a child.[A][N]
So all this time, Edain, you've been[N]
praying for her sake, haven't you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Have you been fighting for Yngvi as well?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
When the news of your abduction reached us,[N]
the thought of you in danger while I just sat[A][N]
at home was unberable![N]
I came to Yngvi as quickly as I could.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hold on. You are the younger brother of[N]
Lord Arvis of Velthomer, are you not?[A][N]
Did he allow you to come?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, I[...][N]
I came without his consent.[A][N]
And he certainly won't be pleased.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why would you do something so reckless, then?[N]

Please, forgive me[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
The important part is that you're safe as well,[N]
Midir. Please, don't worry about it.[A][N]
You gave your all to protect me,[N]
and I couldn't thank you enough for that,[A][N]
even if you didn't succeed.[A][N]
For now I'd like you to remain with Sigurd.[N]
He could use your strength.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Certainly, milady.[A][N]

##QuanAyraTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadAyra][OpenMidLeft][LoadQuan]
Princess Ayra of Isaach, I presume?[A][N]
I heard your story story from Sigurd.[N]
I am Quan of Leonster.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A pleasure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'd hate to press you for information so soon,[N]
but there's something I'd like to know.[A][N]
Why did Isaach attack[N]
Dahna in the first place?[A][N]
Surely you knew doing so[N]
would invoke the wrath of Grannvale.[A][N]
That King Mananan would commit such a[N]
reckless act[...] The very idea defies belief.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You knew my father, Sir Quan?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm afraid I never had the chance to meet him.[N]
However, my father knows him well.[A][N]
He's always had only the utmost praise for him.[A][N]
He also speaks fondly of your brother,[N]
Prince Mariccle.[A][N]
He's always said he is a fine young man.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so? It heartens me to hear it.[A][N]
Without a doubt, my father and Mariccle[N]
were admirable men.[A][N]
Never would they condone such an assault[N]
on a defenseless city.[A][N]
In the matter of Dahna, the patriarch of Ribaut[N]
acted alone and without our consent[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I beg your pardon?![N]
Why haven't the Grannvalians heard this?[A][N]
Surely if Prince Kurth knew the truth,[N]
he would refuse to continue the war.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
So, too, thought my father.[A][N]
Once he executed the Ribaut patriarch,[N]
he departed for the Grannvale front,[A][N]
head in tow,[N]
to negotiate with them.[A][N]
But[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]Yes?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My father, the king[...][N]
He was assassinated on the way.[A][N]
Once word of this returned to Isaach,[N]
the people were utterly incensed.[A][N]
Mariccle set out, leading our entire army,[N]
seeking vengeance against Grannvale.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Something is amiss here.[A][N]
The murder of a king who seeks peace talks[N]
certainly isn't like Prince Kurth, either.[A][N]
Have you told Sigurd of this as well?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
No. Lord Sigurd carries enough of a burden[N]
as it is. It's too late for my brother[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Prince Mariccle was resigned to his death[N]
when he engaged Grannvale, wasn't he[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
My brother believed to[N]
the last that Isaach's hope[A][N]
for the future rests[N]
in Shannan, his son.[A][N]

Oh[...] You must be the town elder![N]
That woman who ran off just now[...][A][N]
Do you know who she is?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

That woman is called Deirdre.[A][N]
She is a priestess of the spirit forest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Deirdre[...][N]
She's beautiful[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ohoho, even a refined man like you[N]
can't resist being charmed by her ilk![A][N]
Could it be love at first sight? Hoho[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sir, please. Don't tease me.[A][N]
And yet[...] I've never seen anybody so beautiful[N]
before. I[...] I need to see her again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Alas, sir, for it cannot be so.[A][N]
The folk of the spirit forest staunchly refuse to[N]
partake in the world beyond their woods.[A][N]
Furthermore, that girl and members of her clan[N]
are forbidden from ever liasing with men.[A][N]
Village lore dictates that should this[N]
ever happen, calamity would befall the world.[A][N]
You have no choice, sir.[N]

##JamkeLastPersuasion
[OpenMidRight][LoadBatu][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
Father, this is absurd![N]
Why do you still refuse to listen to me?[A][N]
My brothers already have fallen,[N]
and it's only a matter of time before[A][N]
they come for the capital as well.[A][N]
The Grannvale commander, Sir Sigurd,[N]
is a good man.[A][N]
Please, end the war while you still can![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I[...] allowed Munnir's raid only because[N]
I'd been told that Grannvale[A][N]
would surely come to invade us first.[A][N]
Never did I intend for a war like this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It was that sorcerer, Sandima, who told you[N]
that, wasn't it?[A][N]
You, Cimbaeth, and Munnir trusted him too[N]
readily. You've all been deceived![A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadBatu][OpenFarRight][LoadSandima]
Now, now, Prince Jamke.[N]
That's enough of that.[A][N]
Your duty as prince is to lead your men[N]
into the fray.[A][N]
Dawdling in a place like this would[N]
be deeply troublesome of you.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Argh! Damn you, Sandima![A][N][OpenRight]
That's enough, Jamke. Listen to Sandima.[N]
Go. Lead your men into the fray.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Father![N]
[...]Very well.[A][N]
If you won't change your mind, even now,[N]
then[...] I'll see this through as well.[A][N]
But be warned.[A][N]
Should I return victorious, Sandima,[N]
I'll allow you to live no longer![A][X]

##VerdaneShenanigans
[OpenMidRight][LoadSandima][OpenMidLeft][LoadBatu]
Sandima[...][A][N]
Perhaps, for all this time, you may not have[N]
been entirely forthright with me.[A][N]
You did assure me that Grannvale hungers to[N]
claim our land, and yet[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Feh[...] And what are you saying now?[A][N]
To think, I believed that you[N]
Verdanites would be of use[...][A][N]
You truly are naught but savages.[A][N]
You are worthless.[A][N]
Completely and utterly worthless![N]
And from now on, your army[N]

What?! No, stay back![N]

Feh[...] Feeble-minded old fool.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadManfroy]
So, you've put an end to the king, Sandima[...][A][N]
Do you expect that the Verdanite army will still[N]
obey your command?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, Archbishop Manfroy![ToggleSmile][N]
How long have you been here, Your Eminence?[A][N]
The army is of no concern at all.[N]
They need only to know that[N]
the king has fallen ill.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hrm, I see[...][A][N]
And what of the situation here?[N]
Does the plan progress?[A][N][OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
My sincerest apologies, Your Excellency.[A][N]
That Grannvalian[...][N]
Sigurd, or something,[A][N]
has proven to be an unexpected obstacle[N]
to the invasion.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hm[...] And what of the search for the Loptrian[N]
scion? Have you found Cigyun's daughter?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er[...] No, not yet[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Imbecile![A][N]
After all of the pains I have gone to,[N]
to locate the boy[...][A][N]
The son of Cigyun is still in Belhalla,[N]
but he's worthless without the female.[A][N]
Listen well. Cigyun was an eir of Prince Maera,[N]
brother of an emperor of the Loptrian Empire.[A][N]
Cigyun alone in this era inherited the sacred blood[N]
of the dark lord.[A][N]
That woman broke the commandment that Maera[N]
placed upon his heirs and bore two children.[A][N]
Do you know what this means?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, Your Eminence.[A][N]
When the blood of the two heirs intersects,[N]
the second coming of the dark lord, Loptous,[A][N]
will be upon us.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Precisely, and so too shall we, descendants of[N]
the Loptrian Empire, return to this world.[A][N]
You know as well as I, Sandima,[N]
how heavily our fates depend upon[A][N]
the resurrection of the dark lord.[A][N]
You know well our order's centuries of exile,[N]
hidden deep within the Aed Desert.[A][N]
You know well the abuses[...] The famines[...][A][N]
How we were sustained only by dreaming of[N]
the day when the Empire will rise again.[A][N]
And at long last, that day is upon us.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Understood, Your Eminence.[A][N]
If I must surrender my life to ensure that[N]
the plan is realized, I will do it gladly![A][X]

Withdraw immediately, or I will take action.[N]
We both know you're no match for me.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's this? Eldigan?![A][N]
I should've known you would[N]
side with Grannvale![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
In doing this you are crossing not[N]
just Grannvale, nor me, but your very liege![A][N]
We bow to the reverent King Imca,[N]
who desires only peace with Grannvale.[A][N]
Would you truly cross His Majesty?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You fool![A][N]
Only you would still seriously heed that senile[N]
old fool's word.[A][N]
The lords of Agustria are united against[N]
both Grannvale and any peace with them![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wrong, for I will not stand with you![A][N]
Agustria cannot afford the crippling tolls of war,[N]
and nor can Grannvale.[A][N]
Our past stands as a testament to this.[A][N]
Learn well, Elliot: we, the nobility, know not[N]
the suffering brought by war.[A][N]
War cripples only the powerless, our subjects.[A][N]
I will not abide your lust for glory[N]
at the expense of our people![A][N][OpenMidRight]
A pretty little speech, but that won't save[N]
you now.[A][N]
I knew all along: you and I[N]
were always fated to clash, Eldigan![A][N]

Could you be so staunch if it[N]

But Elliot is no mere enemy,[N]

His father is a powerful lord and[N]
there is a process that we must follow.[A][N]
I will appeal to the king and[N]

crossed Verdane's border to wage war.[A][N][OpenRight]
Your intelligence speaks true, sire.[A][N]
Out of concern for our[N]

Elliot to assess the[N]

As you might know, he is an old friend of[N]

whose forces joined in the assault.[A][N]
Eldigan has shown himself a traitor[N]

If justice is due, you shall have it.[N]

Grannvale is bloodthirsty.[N]
First Issach, and now Verdane.[A][N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadChagall][OpenFarRight][LoadMacbeth][OpenRight][LoadBordeaux][OpenLeft][LoadImca]
Are all who were summoned in attendance?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Yes, my dear father.[A][N]
Lord Bordeaux stands before you[N]
aside Lords Macbeth, Othello, and Clement.[A][N][OpenLeft]
Yes, I do apologize.[A][N]
It's getting harder to[N]
see clear in my old age.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I am your humble servant.[A][N]
I shall aid you in[N]
all matters of government.[A][N][OpenLeft]
It's come to my attention that a Grannvale army[N]
led by Sigurd of Chalphy has[A][N]
crossed Verdane's border to wage war.[A][N][OpenRight]
Your intelligence speaks true, sire.[A][N]
Out of concern for our[N]
own lands I sent my beloved[A][N]
Elliot to assess the[N]
situation for any threats,[A][N]
and he was attacked by Lord Eldigan.[A][N]
The poor boy returned to[N]
me on the brink of death.[A][N]
As you might know, he is an old friend of[N]
Lord Sigurd and Lord Quan of Leonster,[A][N]
whose forces joined in the assault.[A][N]
Eldigan has shown himself a traitor[N]
to our nation and must hang immediately![A][N][OpenLeft]
That is[...] difficult to accept.[A][N]
The Nordions have always been staunch patriots.[N]
But I promise you, Lord Bordeaux,[A][N]
the matter will be investigated[N]
and resolved accordingly.[A][N]
If justice is due, you shall have it.[N]
Chagall, may I entrust this matter to you?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
It would be my honor. Heheheh[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenFarRight]
Grannvale is bloodthirsty.[N]
First Issach, and now Verdane.[A][N]
With their size and number[N]
of Holy Blood heirs,[A][N]
they pose a serious threat.[A][N]
I do believe it would be prudent[N]
to begin marshaling our forces in preparation.[A][X]

##ClementSpeaks
[OpenFarRight][LoadOthello][OpenRight][LoadMacbeth][OpenLeft][LoadClement]
It would be prudent not to act hastily.[N]
My sources say that Verdane acted first.[A][N]
With Lord Byron and the preponderance of his[N]
army that watches the border away at war,[A][N]
Munnir and Cimbaeth capitalized on the[N]
weakness and attacked Jungby,[A][N]
kidnapping Lord Ring's daughter, Edain.[A][N]
That Sigurd and a small entourage[N]
pursued to rescue her.[A][N]
We all know those Verdanians are a[N]
pack of uncouth savages.[A][N]
Our own skirmishes with them over[N]
the years more than prove that.[A][N]
Thieves and rapists, the lot of them![A][N][OpenFarRight]
You've always been a coward, Lord Clement.[N]
Afraid of getting your hands dirty.[A][N]
Always waiting to see who comes out[N]
on top so you might play for favor.[A][N][OpenLeft]
You dare speak to me in such a manner, pup?[A][N]
If Anphony has an opinion of me,[N]
I will hear it from its lord, not the spare.[A][N][OpenRight]
Lord Clement is right, Othello.[N]
You speak out of turn.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
My apologies.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I do not intend to advocate to Grannvale,[A][N]
only to make the point that raising[N]
our armies in such volume could alarm them.[A][N]
If they believe we are preparing for war,[A][N]
Grannvale would invade us when they[N]
may not have planned to at all.[A][N]
It would be an invitation to shed blood.[A][X]

##ImcaContinues
[OpenFarLeft][LoadChagall][OpenFarRight][LoadMacbeth][OpenRight][LoadBordeaux][OpenLeft][LoadImca]
Clement speaks wisely.[A][N]
Politics and statesmanship are[N]
such delicate matters.[A][N]
If we show strength, we look[N]
weak and afraid.[A][N]
Wars are won in the shadows.[A][N]
But the best victories are the battles[N]
that never have to be fought.[A][N]
Alas, I do believe we should have some[N]
preparations should the worst come to pass.[A][N]
We will not bring all of our forces to bear,[A][N]
but you are allowed to prepare[N]
your troops to brace for an attack.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I will coordinate with the lords see to it[N]
that your wishes are carried out, father.[A][N][OpenLeft]
I have been blessed with a fine son.[N]
Someday you will even make a fine king.[A][N]
I shall adjourn this meeting.[A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]
I grow tired.[N]
You may go.[A][N][OpenRight]
Yes, Sire![A][X]

Yet you walk the path of deception[N]
he alluded to well, Prince Chagall.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Manfroy? Watching from the corner[N]
like always. I should have expected.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My position and cause[N]
demand a degree of illusiveness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is everything in place?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed they are. My men[N]
are ready on your pleasure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Let's get it done.[A][N]
That crown is begging for[N]
a proper head to rest on.[A][X]

##SigurdFindsDeirdre
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadDeirdre]
Wait[...][N]
Lord Sigurd[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm? Is that[...] Deirdre! Ah![N]
So this must be your spirit forest.[A][N]
Thank the gods![A][N]
For a moment I thought that I might[N]
never see you again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Milord, listen. The dark priest Sandima[N]
guards Castle Verdane with his wicked magic.[A][N]
You must go no further. You would surely be killed.[N]
Please, you mustn't go[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
But I mustn't place my men in even greater[N]
danger, either.[A][N]
I have no choice but to go.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I see.[N]
Then I will go with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excuse me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is called a Silence staff.[A][N]
So long as my own power is enough[N]
to pierce his magical resistances,[A][N]
it will seal his magic away.[A][N]
Trust me, milord.[A][N]
I'll ensure his dark spells never[N]
harm anyone ever again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'd never imagined that you'd have such power[...][N]
But why[...] Why are you helping me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
[...]I tried to forget you all I could,[N]
but it was all in vain.[A][N]
[...]I no longer know what I should do[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What is it that you're afraid of, Deirdre?[N]
I don't understand.[A][N]
But if you and I feel the same way,[N]
then surely we've nothing to fear.[A][N]
I[...] I love you, Deirdre[...][A][X]

And I thought you promised[N]
to stop thievery![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
I did, I swear! I joined[N]
Sigurd's army instead.[A][N]
No more thievin' around![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]

Hold on! What about you?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadJamke]
Wh-what do you mean?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
Didn't you promised Edain[N]

Edain!?[N]
What are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You said you would persuade your father, yet[N]
instead you've taken to the field yourself.[A][N]
What is the matter with you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
My father is a changed man.[N]
My words can no longer reach him[...][A][N]
[...]It all started when that sorcerer,[N]
Sandima, arrived.[A][N]
My entire family now obeys his every word.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This is why I ask[...][N]
Why have you taken to the field?[A][N]
Please, Jamke.[N]
Join us. Let's go to Verdane together.[A][N]
We can reason with the king, one more time.[N]
We can put an end to this war![A][N]
Lord Sigurd has no interest in invading[N]
Verdane. He fought only to rescue me.[A][N]
Please listen, Jamke.[N]
Please[...] I beg of you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fine[...] If you're willing to go so far,[N]
then I'll stain my name with treason.[A][N]
But it must be understood that I won't[N]
let anyone lay a finger on my father.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, I will promise you that.[N]

I'm no traitor, Burkaul.[N]
We've been misguided and betrayed.[A][N]
I will not see my homeland[N]

because of Sandima's[N]
machinations.[A][N]
Munnir and Cimbaeth[N]

What more must we lose[N]

Oh no. My axe isn't anything as fine[N]

It's just a plain old iron axe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

This village is part of the holdings[N]
of Prince Cimbaeth, lord of Genoa.[A][N]
He's as dreadful as they come![A][N]
Barely a month goes by without him settin'[N]
his army on us. It's terrifyin'![A][N]
King Batu, his father, used to do such a[N]
fine job keepin' him in check.[A][N]

King Batu is as gentle as they come.[A][N]
Normally, at least, leading a war like this is[N]
the last thing he'd ever do.[A][N]
Mark my words: this is all the doing of Sandima,[N]
his sorcerous advisor. I can just feel it.[A][N]
Eking out a living here's grown tougher and[N]
tougher since the day that man arrived,[A][N]
and save for the youngest son, Jamke,[N]
both king and country are at his every whim.[A][N]

Just t'the north a here[N]
is this mighty woodland.[A][N]
S'called the spirit forest.[A][N]
Once upon a time, I lived there too,[N]
in this li'l hamlet deep within.[A][N]
Th' village is home to the last kin o'[N]
the dark one of old, Loptous.[A][N]
They say it all started with Saint Maera,[N]
exiled by the empire for darin'[A][N]
to sympathize with mortal men.[A][N]
In my day, there was this gorgeous[N]
girl livin' there called Cigyun:[A][N]
the last heir o' Loptous's[N]
bloodline, she was.[A][N]
She lived 'er life under close guard,[A][N]
the villagers wary o' lettin' the[N]
blood o' Loptous loose into[A][N]
th' world.[A][N]
Alas, Cigyun grew weary o'[N]
the tedious forest life an'[A][N]
she left it all behind,[N]
breakin' ancient commandments.[A][N]
A couple of years later, she came back,[N]
'cept now she was pregnant.[A][N]
Never said who the father was, mind.[A][N]
Before long Cigyun died, even as she[N]
gave birth t' her daughter.[A][N]
From what I 'eard, the hamlet's old prophet[N]
took 'er in and raised the girl as 'er own.[A][N]
