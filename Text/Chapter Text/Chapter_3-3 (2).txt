##EthlynQuanTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadQuan][OpenMidLeft][LoadEthlyn]
Pardon me, dear[...][N]
But I think I owe you an apology.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eh? What's happened, Ethlyn?[N]
By the look of it, it must be grave indeed[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Here. Take this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
A spear? [...]What?![N]
I-isn't this Gae Bolg?![A][N]
Why do you-[N][OpenMidLeft]
Your lord father entrusted it to me, Quan.[N]
He thought it prudent for you to have it at hand, [A][N]
in case our battles grew too fierce.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Even just holding it, I've seldom felt so strong[N]
Why did you wait till now, though?.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
With the spear, your lord father also passed[N]
onto me its tale[...] I'm so sorry[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Aye.[N]
Gae Bolg bears the baggage of a true sad legend.[A][N]
But that is all it is: a legend.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But-[N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn, trust me. Triumph is within our grasp[N]
this day. I'll not fall victim to an old myth.[A][N]
I'll not let it stop me from returning home.[A][N]
Our dear little Altena still awaits us, and[N]
I'll not allow some fairy tale to dissapoint her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes[...] Quan, no matter what happens[...][N]
We'll never lose each other[...] Right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, you're concerned about Deirdre, aren't you[...][N]
There's noting to worry about.[A][N]
It won't be long until we find her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes[...] I want to believe she'll be okay, too.[N]
I wish I could believe it. But[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn? Come now! Dry your tears.[N]
Do you truly feel so bad about this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I[...] Yes[...][A][N]
Knowing th-that Sigurd and Deirdre[N]
may never meet again[...][A][N]
Th-they love each other so[...] so much[...][N]
Why, Quan[...] Why did this happen to them?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn[...][A][X]

##SigurdBrigidTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadBrigid][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
Are you holding up okay, Brigid?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh? Who're you?[N]
Wait[...] How do you know my name?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The villagers told me of a woman who leads[N]
the pirates of Orgahil,[A][N]
and of her devotion to[N]
aiding the poor and weak.[A][N]
That would be you, correct?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You must be that Grannvale man[...][A][N]
Sigurd, right? Guess this is it.[N]
Come on. Just get it over with.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ahahaha![ToggleSmile] Oh no, you're mistaken![N]
I'm certainly not here to kill you.[A][N]
I just want to talk to you, Brigid.[N]
I'd like you to ally with us.[A][N]
We'd love to add your strength to our own,[N]
to help us better fight the pirates. What say you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait.[N]
You really want me, of all people?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Certainly![N]
You'd be a tremendous asset.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're a strange little man, Sigurd[...][A][X]

##MidirBrigidTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadBrigid][OpenMidLeft][LoadMidir]
[...]Lady Edain?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh? Who're you?[N]
You don't look familiar.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, sorry![N]
You're not her. My mistake.[A][N]
But then, that must make you[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's your mumbling about?[N]
Speak up, you weird little man![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Er[...][N]
May I ask your name?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm Brigid.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Brigid[...][N]
You're gorgeous[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Excuse me?![N]
You've gotta be joking![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I must be dreaming...[N]
There's another one...[A][N]
And she's even more beautiful![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ugh[...] That's it![N]
I'm out of here.[A][X]

##EdainBrigidTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadBrigid][OpenMidLeft][LoadEdain]
Pardon me, but are you not[...][N]
Yes! It is you! My sister! Brigid![A][N]
I'm Edain, your sister![N]
Surely you recall me?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What? How do you know my name?[N]
Hang on[...] You look just like me![A][N]
Edain, huh[...]It sounds kinda familiar[...][N]
But where from?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Brigid, listen well. I am your twin sister![A][N]
We lost you to pirates years ago,[N]
when you were just five years old.[A][N]
I've searched for you for years.[N]
I never lost hope that we would meet again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This is all so sudden[...][A][N]
No. Weird feelings like this aren't enough![N]
I need proof![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Proof, you say?[N]
Here. Draw this bow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh?[A][N]
Okay, that's a nice bow and all,[N]
but what's it gotta do with anything?[A][N]
Guess I'll humor you.[A][N]
So I draw it and-[N]
...Whoa! W-what's going on?![A][N]
The hell is this[...]?
I[...] What's this weird feeling boiling within me[...][A][N]
Are these[...] memories?[N]
Ah[...] my heart is on fire[...] Edain?[N]
Yes[...] I remember now!
You're Edain[...] my sister.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, thank the gods! You remember![N]
That bow is your birthright, Brigid.[A][N]
It is Yewfelle, the sacred bow of Yngvi.
Legends tell that exalted weapons of this land,[A][N]
such as this one, can only be wielded
by a single heir per generation.[A][N]
For House Yngvi and Yewfelle, that rightful
heir is you, Brigid. I trust this proof will suffice?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, Edain[...] Come here[...][N]
Let me get a good look at you[...][A][N]
How's our father doing?[N]
And our brother[...] Andrey, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've so much to tell you, too[...][N]
Brigid[...] My sister.[A][X]

##ClaudSigurdTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadClaud]
Lord Sigurd![N]
I apologize for the wait.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Father Claud, you're safe![A][N]
We heard about how you ended up amidst[N]
all those pirates. Everyone was so worried.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm glad Tailtiu was close at hand. We may not[N]
have survived, if not for her magic.[A][N]
More importantly, Lord Sigurd,[A][N]
my prayers to Saint Bragi were answered.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You have the truth of all this, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That I do. As I thought, Duke Reptor [N]
is behind all of this.[A][N]
On his orders, it was[N]
Duke Lombard who killed Prince Kurth.[A][N]
The two then succesfully framed your father,
Lord Byron, for the crime.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Just as I thought[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
The pair's treachery runs deeper still.[A][N]
The murder of Isaach's King Mananan[N]
was also the handiwork of Duke Reptor.[A][N]
He feared a peaceful end to the war would end[N]
the sole excuse for the conquest of Isaach,[A][N]
so he secretly had the king killed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so[...][N]
Reptor's grubby hands are all over this mess[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not quite. In the shade of his avarice,[N]
there's something else at work..[A][N]
Something unsettling and terrifying.[A][N]
Not even Lord Bragi could scry this evil presence,[N]
obscured by its power as it is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
An evil presence?[N]
Could it be that dark priesthood[...][A][N]
Wait! What of my father, Claud?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Byron yet lives, but is injured and weak.[N]
I fear he is not long for this world[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Father[...][N]
This can't be happening[...][A][N]
I'll hasten to the capital.[N]
His Majesty needs to hear the truth.[A][N]
Lord Sigurd, for the time being,[N]
stay here and restrain yourself from rash action.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Understood.[A][N]
I can't thank you enough, Father Claud.[A][N]
I beg of you, do everything you can.[N]
Save my father and his good name.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Our fates lie with the mercy of the gods[...][A][X]

##DewSecret
[OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
Oh, whoa! This is that Tower of Bragi[N]
place, isn't it? Hee hee![ToggleSmile][A][N]
Got a good thiefy feeling about this one![N]

Mmm? Nope, nothin' over here.[N]
Over there, maybe?[A]
[...]Aww, man![N]
What a borin' little dump.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Huh?![A][N][OpenMidRight]

Heh, maybe If I pretend I can't hear'em[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]

##DewKickedOut

Hah[...] hah[...] What just happened?![N]

What is she doin' here?[N]

S'only matter of time b'fore them Grannvale[N]
guys're bangin' down our doors too, eh?[A][N]
What d'ya say?[N][A][OpenMidRight]
Damn it, Duvall![A][N]

You've got nobody but yourself to blame![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Keh, enough![A][N]
I can't take yer arrogance anymore![N]

Aren't you done praying already?[A][N]
Just look around! There'll be pirates all over us[N]
if we don't get moving![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Be at peace, Tailtiu.[N]
This was quite the fruitful journey![A][N]
Lord Bragi has answered my prayers and[N]
revealed to me the truth.[A][N]
It is precisely as I had thought.[A][N]
Not to mention, I even found House Edda's[N]
long-lost sacred heirloom within the tower:[A][N]
the staff of Valkyrie.[N]
See? This is it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What, that grubby little cane?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Tailtiu, please.[N]
Do try to mind your manners.[A][N]
This is a legendary magical staff with the power[N]
to restore life to the deceased.[A][N]
It is usable only by the direct descendants[N]
of Saint Bragi.[A][N]
That is to say, me alone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh. So what you're saying is,[A][N]
with this rod you could bring my[N]
sweet old grandma back to life?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alas, most likely not.[A][N]
Valkyrie is limited in many particular ways,[N]
and so cannot be used on just any lost soul.[A][N]
You see, all of mankind is born[N]
bearing a life force called quintessence, which-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yaaawn[...] Er, what's that? You lost me.[A][N]
Why're you talking about this anyway?[N]

Ah, of course.[N]
Let us go.[A][X]

Is the army ready? Good.[N]
All units, move in![A][N]
Apprehend the traitor Sigurd[N]
and his cohorts![A][N]
Seize these viles allies of Byron,[A][N]
accomplices to his murder of Kurth[N]
and his bid to take over the kingdom![A][N]
It is the will of His Majesty![N]
No mercy for enemies of the state![A][X]

##DoubleTrouble
[OpenMidRight][LoadReptor]
Kehehe[...][ToggleSmile] Oh, Langbalt.[N]
Such audacity![A][N]
To think, he personally put an end[N]
to that miserable prince and[A][N]
nearly kiled Byron for[N]
putting up a fight[...][A][N]
I've never seen such a bold ploy! And with Arvis[N]
using His Majesty's trust, it all worked flawlessly![A][N]
Convincing the king of anything[N] 
is hardly a challenge,[A][N]
but to succeed with a tale of[N]
this scale takes quite the storyteller...[A][N]
And here we are, with the entirety[N]
of House Chalphy framed for the crime![A][N]
Heh heh[...][ToggleSmile] Our victory is all but assured.[A][N]
The throne of Grannvale shall be mine,[N]
one way or another.[A][N]
I'll leave no pest who dares interfere with me
alive[...][A][X]

##Treason
[OpenMidRight][LoadOifey][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
What in the blazes is this?![A][N]
I'm a traitor now, and a Grannvale legion[N]
now waits at our doorstep to arrest me?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sire[...] And to think,[N]
the war here was over at long last,[A][N]
and you were about to go and search for Deirdre.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Gah[...][N]
How could His Majesty have fallen for Reptor's lies?[A][N]
How could he possibly believe that[N]
my father, of all people, would kill Prince Kurth?[A][N]
Aah[...] If only Father Claud had gotten back[N]
to the capital before they struck...[A][N]
Why?! Why is this happening?![A][N]
I fought a pointless war, I let Eldigan die, and now this![N]
What have I been fighting for all along?![A][N][OpenMidRight]

I am Annand, a knight in the service of Silesse.[A][N]

We invite you and your subordinates to retreat with us[N]
to Silesse, until your good name has been cleared in Grannvale.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Queen Lahna of Silesse, you say?[A][N]
Why is Silesse willing to give aid[N]
