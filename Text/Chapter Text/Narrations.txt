##Prologue_Narration
At the heart of the continent[N]
of Jugdral lies Grannvale,[A][N]
a kingdom founded by Saint[N]
Heim of the Twelve Crusaders.[A][N]
Supporting the royal family, the[N]
heirs of Heim, are six noble houses,[A][N]
each also descended[N]
from a Crusader of old.[A][N]
The six states, while still[N]
subservient to the royal family,[A][N]
each occupy vast[N]
swaths of Grannvale's land[A][N]
and maintain mighty militaries[N]
of their own.[A][N]
Owing to King Azmur's advanced age,[N]
the governance of Grannvale[N]
falls to his son,[A][N]
the highly respected Prince Kurth.[N]
Kurth has two trusted advisors in his rule:[A][N]
Lord Byron from House Chalphy,[N]
and Lord Ring from House Yngvi.[A][N]
Grannvale's chancellor,[N]
Lord Reptor of Friege,[A][N]
has long objected to the threat to his[N]
influence posed by Kurth[N]
and his advisors,[A][N]
and has allied himself[N]
with the avaricious[N]
Lord Lombard of House Dozel[A][N]
to form a faction[N]
opposed to Kurth's rule[N]
over Grannvale.[A][N]
The young duke of House Velthomer,[N]
Lord Arvis, leads the Royal Guard[A][N]
in the king's care and[N]
so has little time[N]
for the circus of politics.[A][N]
Only Father Claud of House Edda,[N]
could foresee the oncoming storm.[A][N]
Into the midst of this tense situation,[N]
comes dire news from Jugdral's east.[A][N]
Darna, a town in the Aed Desert with[N]
deeps ties to Grannvale,[A][N]
is now besieged by savage[N]
warriors from Isaach.[A][X]

##Prologue_Narration2
Reports of a brutal massacre abound.[A][N]
The news is met by the people of Grannvale[N]
with furious cries for retribution,[A][N]
and before long the kingdom[N]
declares war on Isaach.[A][N]
Prince Kurth leads the Grannvale's[N]
charge on his father's behalf,[A][N]
commanding the military might[N]
of the kingdom's six houses.[A][N]
At Kurth side as always is none other[N]
than Lord Byron, a highly decorated hero[N]
of peerless valor in his own right.[A][N]
Grannvale has poured its entire miliary[N]
might into the Isaach campaign,[N]
and precious few soldiers remain behind.[A][X]

##Prologue_Narration3
With its neighbors - Agustria to the west[N]
and Verdane to the south -[A][N]
bound in alliance with Grannvale, none dare[N]
to dream they could ever be threatened.[A][N]
It is not long at all, however, before[N]
the people's confidence is shattered.[A][N]
As if from nowhere, a vast horde[N]
from Verdane led by Prince Munnir[A][N]
crosses the Grannvale border and lays[N]
siege to Yngvi Castle.[A][N]
In Lord's Ring absence, his daughter,[N]
Lady Edain, is Yngvi's only guardian.[A][N]
Lord Byron has entrusted the defense[N]
of Grannvale in his absence to his son,[A][N]
Sigurd, who remains at Chalphy Castle[N]
with a mere handful of soldiers.[A][N]
A fiend of Edain since childhood,[N]
Sigurd is horrified to hear the Yngvi siege,[A][N]
and even with so few soldiers is, determined[N]
to protect Edain and his fatherland[N]
from the savage Verdanite hordes.[A][N]
The year is 757, Grann Calendar.[N]
And so the threshold of fate is cast open.[A][N]
Nobody could have known then[N]
that this simple disturbance was but[N]
the first of countless calamities to come.[A][X]

##Ch1_Narration
Sigurd's capture of Evans [N]
Castle comes too late.[A][N]
Edain's not there, instead already[N]
well within Verdane's borders.[A][N]
Verdane's territory is blanketed[N]
in a thick sweep of the forest.[A][N]
The nation is widely dubbed a[N]
"barbarian kingdom" by Grannvale's people,[A][N]
owing to their constant raids[N]
on Grannvalian soil.[A][N]
However, the reign of King Batu has seen[N]
an end to Verdane's infamous border raids.[A][N]
A pacifist, King Batu has long worked to[N]
build a long lasting peace with Grannvale,[A][N]
while also keeping his[N]
aggressive sons appeased.[A][N]
Ultimately, however, it was Batu himself.[N]
who violated the peace he held so dear.[A][N]
Batu's three sons have unexpectedly[N]
launched an assault on Grannvale.[A][N]
Cimbaeth, the second son, lord of Genoa...[N]
Munnir, the eldest son, lord of Marpha...[A][N]
And Jamke, the youngest of the three,[N]
refused to partake in his brothers' raids.[A][N]
Lurking deep within Verdane territory,[N]
the three now await the arrival of Sigurd.[A][N]
Edain's fate...[N]
Batu's sudden belligerence...[A][N]
Sprawling before Sigurd lie[N]
the great forests[A][N]
of Verdane, and within them,[N]
the answers he seeks.[A][N]
He prepares to take his first steps into[N]
the spirit forest of folklore...[A][X]

##Ch2_Narration
Verdane has fallen to Grannvale.[N]
On orders from Belhalla,[A][N]
Sigurd governs the[N]
region from Evans Castle,[A][N]
with his newly-wed wife[N]
Deirdre ever at his side.[A][N]
However, Grannvale's actions in Verdane[N]
are ill receuved by neighboring Agustria.[A][N]
The lords of Agustria lead a storm[N]
of heated rhetoric denouncing Grannvale.[A][N]
To make matters worse, the renowned[N]
pacifist Agustrian ruler, King Imca,[A][N]
has been slain by an unknown hand.[A][N]
Imca's succesor to the Agustrian crown[N]
is his firstborn son, Prince Chagall.[A][N]
Even as the Agustrian crisis unfolds, the[N]
bulk of Grannvale's army remains in Isaach.[A][N]
And so, Chagall has given the lords[N]
his first command as their new king:[A][N]
[Red]invade Verdane.[Red][A][N]
As the sole defender of Grannvale's front,[N]
Sigurd once again finds himself in battle...[A][X]

##Ch3_Narration
King Chagall has fled Agusti's fall[N]
and moved his royal court to Madino[N]
Castle in the north.[A][N]
Honoring his promise to Eldigan,[N]
Sigurd allows Chagall his freedom[N]
and does not interfere.[A][N]
Sigurd adopts Agusty as his headquarters,[N]
and while his troops here recuperate,[A][N]
he persists in negotiating Agustria's[N]
return to governance by its own king.[A][N]
Despite his determination to restore[N]
Chagall's rule, his orders from[N]
Belhalla never change:[A][N]
to remain in Agusty and to[N]
govern its citizen.[A][N]
Scarcely six months have passed, and yet[N]
Granvalle's ruling administrators have[N]
already grown arrogant and have[N]
taken to abusing their power over[N]
Agustria for their own gain.[A][N]
Day by day, the Agustrian[N]
people grow ever wearier[N]
of Grannvale's actions.[A][N]
Before long, as he feared,[N]
Sigurd finds himself[N]
yet again caught in a new conflct.[A][X]

##Ch3_Narration2
Reports abound of Chagall raising his army[N]
anew at Madino's Castle, vying to reclaim[N]
his lost capital from Sigurd.[A][N]
Further north beyond Madino, the reviled[N]
pirates of Orgahil prepare themselves[N]
to sweep and profit from the land's chaos.[A][N]
Belhalla's orders demand that Sigurd must[N]
maintain control of Agusti above all else.[A][N]
Sigurd's heart lies heavy in the face [N]
of the impending crisis.[A][N]
Southwest of Madino, Eldigan's forces[N]
hold the defenses of Fort Silvail.[A][N]
The looming battle for Agustria...[N]
A trial between friendship and loyalties.[A][N]
Before Sigurd looms a final battle[N]
in Agustria's north:[A][N]
a showdown fated to shape the[N]
course of Jugdral's history.[A][X]

##Ch4_Narration
The unthinkable has come to pass.[A][N]
Sigurd is now a traitor in the eyes[N]
of his beloved Grannvale.[A][N]
In desperation, his army[N]
flees to find refuge[N]
in the northern[N]
Kingdom of Silesse.[A][N]
Silesse was founded by[N]
he Wind Crusader, Ced.[A][N]
It lies under the watchful guard of the[N]
valiant pegasus knights and wind mages,[A][N]
and so for over a century[N]
since its foundation,[N]
Silesse has maintained[N]
itself as a neutral[N]
nation and resisted all invaders.[A][N]
However, ever since the death of[N]
its king several years ago,[A][N]
the royal family has been plagued[N]
with strife over its inheritance,[N]
and shades of war[N]
creeps over the peaceful land.[A][N]
The late king and his wife, Queen Lahna,[N]
had a single son, Prince Lewyn.[A][N]
The king's greedy younger brother,[N]
Duke Daccar, objects to Lewyn being[A][N]
heir to the throne and has confined[N]
himself in Zaxon Castle in protest.[A][N]
As if acting in concert, the king's[N]
youngest brother, Duke Myos,[A][N]
has set to work raising an army[N]
for himself at Thove Castle.[A][N]
Out of disgust at his uncles, Prince Lewyn[N]
left Silesse to travel the world years ago.[A][N]
Is there no end to the dukes' avarice?[N]
Their lust for power will condemn Silesse,[A][N]
a beautiful and majestic land,[N]
to the searing ravages of a brutal war.[A][X]

##Ch5_Narration
The Silessian civil war is over,[N]
and the Grannvale army awaits Sigurd.[A][N]
Zaxon Castle has barely fallen,[N]
yet before Sigurd can so much as rest,[A][N]
the hordes of Grannvale stand before him[N]
at the captured Lubeck Castle.[A][N]
The Grannvale commander, Duke Lombard,[N]
is a longtime enemy of Sigurd's father.[A][N]
For Sigurd, to challenge Lombard[N]
is an opportunity to[N]
avenge his father, Byron,[A][N]
framed by Lombard for his crimes.[N]
Beyond Lubeck, in the desert town Phinora,[A][N]
Lord Arvis's elite warriors stand guard[N]
under the command of the war-mage Vaha.[A][N]
Velthomer Castle, on Grannvale's border[N]
with the Aed Desert, is defended by[N]
Lord Arvis's trusted aide, General Aida.[A][N]
And in Belhalla, the royal[N]
capital of Grannvale,[N]
Lord Arvis serves to aid[N]
the bedridden King Azmur,[A][N]
while Chancellor Reptor of Friege[N]
maintains peace and order in the city.[A][N]
A long road to Belhalla awaits Sigurd...[N]
A clash with Grannvale[N]
en route is inevitable.[A][N]
Sigurd refuses to endanger the people of[N]
Silesse any further in this conflict.[A][N]
He is determined to fight to the end.[N]
The year is Grann 760, early spring.[A][N]
The fields of Silesse peacefully rest[N]
beneath a deep blanket of snow...[A][X]

##Interlude_Narration
The final battle for control of Grannvale[N]
sent its most powerful figures to the grave.[A][N]
Just as he had planned, this left Arvis[N]
as the sole ruling power of the kingdom.[A][N]
Opposition from Silesse and Leonster[N]
was swiftly crushed,[A][N]
and so Arvis unified all Jugdral[N]
under Grannvale's rule.[A][N]
With overwhelming support from his subjects,[N]
Arvis thus became the first Emperor[A][N]
of the Grannvale Empire.[A][N]
Seventeen years have passed since[N]
the Battle of Belhalla.[A][N]
The adoring public who once welcomed[N]
the rise of Emperor Arvis[A][N]
now struggle under his oppressive,[N]
dictatorial rule.[A][N]
And across Jugdral, in the other realms[N]
now domianted by Grannvale,[A][N]
their people have been reduced to living as[N]
little more than slaves to the Empire's whims.[A][X]

##Ch6_Narration
In the former Kingdom of Isaach, Grannvale's[N]
harsh rule tortures the Isaachain people.[A][N]
King Dannan, the appointed king of Isaach,[N]
is a brutal and unforgiving tyrant,[A][N]
just like his late father, Duke Lombard.[A][N]
While Dannan himself lives an indulgent[N]
life at the Ribaut palace,[A][N]
the people remain little more[N]
than slaves to the Empire.[A][N]
His second son, Iuchar, rules Isaach Castle,[N]
while his youngest, Iucharba, rules Sophara.[A][N]
And the remote Ganeishire region is governed by[N]
Dannan's trusted confidant, General Harold.[A][N]
Under their rule, Isaach knows no freedom...[A][N]
However, one last hope remains for Isaach.[A][N]
Tirnanog, an isolated village[N]
in Isaach's far north...[A][N]
There, Prince Shannan works to[N]
raise a liberation army,[A][N]
whose strength grow each passing day.[A][N]
Among these proud, young warriors[N]
is a young man, dubbed the "Scion of Light"[A][N]
by the people of Isaach and revered as the[N]
rightful prince of the Grannvale Empire.[A][N]
He is the brave young leader of the[N]
liberation army. His name is Seliph.[A][N]
[A][X]

##Ch7_Narration
Word of the first victory of Prince Seliph[N]
and his liberation army quickly spreads far[A][N]
and wide, inspiring courage anew[N]
in the Empire's victims.[A][N]
Still more uprisings erupt across Jugdral,[N]
but once again, precious few are[A][N]
properly organized and are esaily crushed,[N]
and the death toll climbs ever higher...[A][N]
Leonster, a kingdom in the Thracian Peninsula...[A][N]
Prince Leif, the son of Quan, had raised an army[N]
with the aid of the knight Finn,[A][N]
but they have suffered a devastating loss[N]
before King Bloom's vast hordes and are[A][N]
stranded in hostile ground.[A][N]
Before Seliph lies the Aed Desert, ruled by the[N]
Loptyrian Kutuzov from the Aed Shrine;[A][N]
the oasis city of Darna,[N]
governed by the ex-merchant Bramsel and[A][N]
the captain of his sellsword army, Jabarro;[A][N]
and Fort Melgen, guarded by Prince Ishtore[N]
and the renowned General Liza.[A][N]
King Bloom himself, the son of the late Duke[N]
Reptor, awaits at the capital city of Ulster[A][N]
with his niece, the mage Tine.[A][N]
In Ribaut, Seliph and the warriors of his[N]
liberation army now prepare themselves[A][N]
to embark on a journey and come to the aid[N]
of their allies in far-away Leonster.[A][N]
Each warrior seys aside their worries as,[N]
under Seliph's leadership,[A][N]
they prepare for the new battle on their horizon.[A][X]

##Ch8_Narration
The two faces of the Thracian Peninsula[N]
are as distinct as night and day.[A][N]
The peninusla's north, once ruled by several[N]
small kingdoms, is graced with rich pastures,[A][N]
while the south, the Kingdom of Thracia, is a[N]
harsh wasteland dominated by vast mountains.[A][N]
In ages past, seeking to claim the[N] 
life-giving northern land as their own,[A][N]
Thracia's infamous dracoknights have led[N]
countless brash attempts to conquer the north,[A][N]
only to be repelled at every turn[N]
by the might of House Leonster.[A][N]
Thracia looked to have won at last following their[N]
slaughter of Leonster's army in the Aed Desert,[A][N]
only to be defeated in turn by Bloom of Friege,[N]
who claimed the land as his own.[A][N]
And so, the so-called Kingdom of North Thracia[N]
was born as yet another servant of the Empire.[a][N]
Over a decade has passed since then.[A][N]
Not even Thracia's King Travant, an ambitious[N]
man with a thirst for power and glory,[A][N]
dares to challenge the will of the Empire,[N]
and so a strange peace looms over the region.[A][N]
Or so it did, until the arrival of Seliph[N]
and his liberation army.[A][N]
Bloom's defeat at his own capital has abruptly[N]
tipped the balance of the Thracian stalemate.[A][N]
Both the Ulster and Leonster territories now[N]
lie under the liberation army's control,[A][N]
forcing Bloom to retreat to Connaught and[N]
muster the strength to take Ulster back.[A][N]
The southern Munster Castle, governed by[N]
the "Thunder Goddess", Princess Ishtar,[A][N]
braces itself for the threat of Thracian invaders.[A][N]
Meanwhile, across the border in Thracia itself,[N]
both King Travant and his border watchman,[A][N]
General Maykov of Meath Castle, remain[N]
eerily silent.[A][N]
The people are united in their fondest wish:[A][N]
for the entirety of the Thracian Peninsula to[N]
return to the rule of House Leonster.[A][N]
And so dawns yet another battle...[A][X]

##Ch9_Narration
With the liberation of the peninusla's north,[N]
Seliph's army occupies Meath Castle[A][N]
as their headquarters, uncertain of how[N]
to next act.[A][N]
Beyond Meath and the engulfing maw of its peaks[N]
lies the dracoknights' kingdom, Thracia.[A][N]
This rural nation is ruled by King Travant, who[N]
remains bound in coalition to Emperor Arvis.[A][N]
Thracia is the only state anywhere in Jugdral[N]
regarded as an ally by the Grannvale Empire.[A][N]
Within Thracia, Travant's minions await Seliph:[N]
his children, Altena and Arion, at the capital;[A][N]
the legendary General Hannibal, dubbed[N]
"Thracia's Shield", at Kapathogia Castle;[A][N]
the king's trusted advisor, General Distler,[N]
at Luthecia Castle;[N]
and a Loptyrian agent from the Empire,[N]
Bishop Judah, at Grutia Castle.[A][N]
Travant has fortified his kingdom for one final,[N]
full-scale showdown with the liberators.[A][N]
Thracia's people hardly offer Seliph an eager[N]
welcome.[A][N]
Fearing Seliph as a conqueror, they flock in[N]
droves to take up arms themselves.[A][N]
How could any justice lie in this conflict?[N]
For whose sake is this war being fought?[A][N]
For the first time, these questions now shake[N]
both Seliph and his army's resolve to the core...[A][X]

##Ch10_Narration
With Thracia's downfall, Seliph sets his sights[N]
on his final destination: Grannvale.[A][N]
His route to the Empire takes him through the[N]
Miletos District, a collective of free cities[A][N]
which was once a vibrant and wealthy hub of[N]
commerce for all of Jugdral.[A][N]
Now, though, only a dying land choked by the[N]
Empire and Loptyrian Order lies before Seliph.[A][N]
At Chronos Castle, the seemingly mad rule of[N]
Queen Hilda has condemned countless citizen[A][N]
to savage, merciless deaths.[A][N]
And in the Rados region, Bishop Morrigan,[N]
under the command of Archbishop Manfroy,[A][N]
conducts child hunt after child hunt.[A][N]
Wealth. Liberty. Hope. Even life itself...[N]
All crumbled through the people's fingers.[A][N]
As the evil cult plies its sacrifical rituals[N]
and pile the bodies of their victims higher,[A][N]
Seliph knows he cannot leave Miletos be.[A][N]
Greeted by raucous cheers from the people,[N]
the liberation army routed the Empire's men[A][N]
in a fierce battle, freeing the city of Perlucos.[A][N]
The hope of Miletos had slowly been rotting away[N]
in the Empire's hands, but at long last,[A][N]
the arrival of Seliph and his liberation army[N]
breathes new life into the nation's future.[A][X]

##Final_Narration
Seliph's long journey is drawing to a close.[N][N]
His army's victories are a beacon of hope[N]
to the Empire's victims, and a wave of[A][N]
further rebellions sweeps across Jugdral.[A][N]
First, Silesse was wrestled back from[N]
imperial control by its citizens,[A][N]
and soon after, Agustria's people flocked[N]
to arms, burning to fight for their country.[A][N]
But Grannvale itself yet stands.[A][N]
Duke Brian of Dozel, his wife Dahlia, and the[N]
axe knights of the GrauenRitter;[A][N]
Duke Scorpius of Yngvi and his elite archers,[N]
the BeigenRitter;[A][N]
and Friege's Queen Hilda and the war-mages[N]
of the GelbenRitter stand between Seliph[A][N]
and the capital.[A][N]
Belhalla itself lurks under an eerie silence,[N]
as Ishtar and twelve enigmatic figures[N]
lie in wait to defend Prince Julius himself.[A][N]
Over a year has passed since that fateful[N]
first battle in Isaach.[A][N]
The tragic struggle pitting kin verus kin[N]
wears on, splitting the new Twelve Crusaders[A][N]
between the light and the dark...[A][N]
So begins the final holy war...[A][X]
