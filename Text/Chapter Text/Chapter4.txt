##MeetingQueenLahna
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadOifey]
Sire, Queen Lahna is here to see you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Queen Lahna?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadLahna]
Good evening, Lord Sigurd.[N]
Are you comfortably settled into Sailane yet?[A][N]
Is there anything at all that you need?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
As much as I appreciate the offer, we're fine,[N]
I can't thank you enough for your hospitality,[A][N]
Your Highness.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I know Sailane is perhaps too small[N]
to house all of you adequately, and I'm sorry,[A][N]
but please, bear with me for a while longer.[N]
I'm doing all I can to hasten your liberty.[A][N]
I've sent letter after letter to Belhalla to[N]
advocate for your innocence.[A][N]
As of yet, however, I've still heard nothing at all[N]
from King Azmur.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] This has to be Reptor's doing![A][N]
First he betrays my father, and now he's[N]
stopping all of your letters! He must be![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Calm yourself, Lord Sigurd![A][N]
I know well the pain you're feeling,[N]
but you cannot let your grudges rule you.[A][N]
Your anger will not save your father.[N]
Hatred will only destroy you from within.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry, Your Highness.[N]
I really appreciate all you've done for me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's alright, Lord Sigurd.[N]
Oh, before I forget[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Thereactually has been some good new[N]
from Grannvale of late.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Good news, you say?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm. A previously unknown daughter[N]
of Prince Kurth has been discovered.[A][N]
All of Grannvale is rejoicing at the news.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh?![N]
Is that even possible?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It took King Azmur only a glance to recognize[N]
her true heritage.[A][N]
She bears the brand of Naga,[N]
the proof of a true heir to House Belhalla.[A][N]
There is no doubt. She is Kurth's child.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thank goodness. At the very least,[N]
this means the royal lineage won't go extinct.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's not all.[N]
The princess and Duke Arvis are in a relationship.[A][N]
King Azmur has given his blessing,[N]
and a magnificent wedding will soon be held.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Arvis? Really?[N][A][OpenMidLeft]
All who've seen the happy couple eagerly attest[N]
that this beautiful princess and Duke Arvis are[A][N]
perfectly matched together.[A][N]
To say nothing of how happy the couple[N]
is said to be![A][N]
Young love is wonderful, isn't it?[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Oh. Lord Sigurd, I'm so sorry.[N]
I forgot. Your wife is still-[A][N]
Deirdre[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
My wife's still gone, yes[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's been over a year since she vanished. She's[N]
missed an entire year of watching Seliph grow up.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm so sorry, Lord Sigurd, but cheer up.[N]
I know you'll reunite someday.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're right. I feel it, too.[A][N]
I can't give in to sorrow just yet.[N]
I can't give up on finding her.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadSigurd][OpenFarRight][LoadAnnand]
Pardon me, milady, but the hour is late.[N]
We should be on our way soon.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, of course. I'll be with you in a moment.[A][N][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Sigurd, one last thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Beware of Duke Myos of Tofa.[A][N]
I regret to say that my brother-in-law has[N]
long hungered to claim Sailane for himself.[A][N]
It's only a matter of time till he goes[N]
so far as to attack you.[A][N]
I wish I could provide you[N]
with reinforcements, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I know. The capital is under the very same[N]
threat from Duke Daccar of Zaxon.[A][N]
You cannot afford to weaken your own guard. Daccar[N]
will pounce upon you given even a hint of weakness.[A][N]
Don't worry about it, Your Highness.[A][N]
There's nothing the Tofa army can throw at us[N]
that we can't handle.[ToggleSmile][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ah, of course. I should be more confident[N]
in such veteran heroes as yourselves[A][N]
Oh! I've been talking for so long, I lost track[N]
of the time. Take care, Lord Sigurd.[A][N][OpenRight]
You too, Your Highness.[N]
Thank you.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadLewyn]
Mother![N]
Aren't you forgetting somebody?[A][N]
You've just chattered for hours and hours with Sigurd,[N]
yet you can't even acknowledge your own son?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My son? The one who abandoned me[N]
two years ago, going gods know where?[A][N]
How do I talk to someone who's clearly not here?[N][A][OpenMidRight]
Heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] So this is how it's going to be,[N]
is it? You're still mad at me, then?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course I am![A][N]
Do you have any idea how hard it was without[N]
you, and how worried I've been after you?[A][N]
That my own son could be so cold-hearted[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I thought I knew you better than this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Look, I know you're upset,[N]
but I had my reasons for all this.[A][N]
But come on, I'm home safely! Surely that[N]
counts for something and you can forgive me?[A][N]
I swear I'll make up for it and be the[N]
very picture of a good son.[A][N]
Hey, how about I give you a[N]
shoulder massage to start?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh! What nerve![N]
Treating me as if I'm an old crone[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Look, Lewyn, there are more pressing[N]
matters which we need to talk about, and soon.[A][N]
Come to Silesse as soon as possible.[N]
Do not forget! Do I make myself clear?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sigh.[N]
I thought she'd never stop.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadLahna][OpenFarLeft][LoadAnnand]
Don't be fooled by your mother's[N]
outward behavior, milord.[A][N]
She's actually very happy, now you've returned.[A][N]
Indeed, she hasn't been anything as cheerful[N]
as this since before you left.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, Annand.[N]
Knowing you're at her side is a big relief.[A][N]
Look after her, okay?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Yes, sir! Rest assured,[N]
I will protect the queen with my life,[A][N]
on my honor as the captain of[N]
the Heavenly Knights of Silesse.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks. Oh, one more thing[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Are you gonna leave Erin here with Sigurd?[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]
Milord, I'd like you to keep my sister at your side. She-[A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenRight][LoadLewyn][OpenFarRight][LoadErinys]
Annand![A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Oh.[N]
Eavesdropping, were you, Erin?[A][N][OpenFarRight]
You were about to tell him too much, so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Ah. My apologies, Erin. There are things[N]
he shouldn't know just yet, of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Erin, I'll be leaving with Queen Lahna[N]
and returning to Silesse Castle shortly.[A][N]
You'll stay here and keep an eye on Prince Lewyn.[N]
Best of luck.[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Thank you, Annand.[A][X]

##QuanLeavesTheArmy
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadQuan]
Sigurd, we'll now be taking our leave.[N]
It's high time we returned to Leonster.[A][N]
Rest assured, we'll be back, this time leading[N]
the full military might of Leonster to your aid.[A][N]
May that day come soon, my friend.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][LoadQuan][OpenFarLeft][LoadEthlyn]
I'm going with Quan, Sigurd. Don't worry, though.[N]
We'll be back before you know it![N]
Take care of yourself.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFinn]
By your leave, sir, I'll be departing with my lord.[N]
Thank you for all you've done for us.[A][N]
Don't give up, sir.[N]
One day, I know, the charges against you[A][N]
will be cleared and your good name restored.[N]
I know you can do this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you. You've got quite the journey[N]
back to Leonster ahead of you.[A][N]
I wish I could do more to help you on your way.[N]
May your journey be a safe one![A][X]

##TofaPrepareForAction
[OpenMidRight][LoadDithorba][OpenMidLeft][LoadMyos]
Dithorba![N]
Is the army ready to deploy yet?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir. Bishop Cuvuli's wind mage unit has[N]
infiltrated the forests near Sailane.[A][N]
Marlon and Snevejr are also positioned nearby.[N]
They await your command, sir.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well.[N]
Relay my orders to Cuvuli: move in on Sailane![A][N]
As for the other two, their squadon will[N]
maintain their current positions.[A][N]
Dithorba, I trust your pegasus corps are[N]
already briefed on your mission?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir. Our task is clear.[A][N]
My squadron is to raid the enemy from above,[N]
disrupting their tactics.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Good.[N]
Now get to work![A][N][OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Grannvale will owe us a handsome reward for[N]
bringing them the heads of their infamous traitors![A][N]
Heh heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][X]

##SigurdClaudTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadClaud][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this mess as well,[N]
Father Claud.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's fine. If anything, I'm sorry that my[N]
efforts to aid you simply weren't enough.[A][N]
I did return to Grannvale, and I was about to[N]
relate the truth to His Majesty.[A][N]
But Reptor interfered before I could do anything,[N]
and now I, too, am branded a traitor to the motherland.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ugh. I've had enough of just sitting here and[N]
letting Reptor have his sorry way![A][N]
I swear, I've half a mind to storm straight[N]
into Grannvale and end this once and for all![A][N][OpenMidRight]
No. You know better than to rely on brute force[N]
or to risk the common folk's safety.[A][N]
For now, Lord Sigurd, we must endure.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But, Father Claud-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Make no mistake. I feel your pain, too,[N]
but this crisis's end now lies in fate's hands.[A][N]
There is nothing any of us can do[N]
to save ourselves anymore.[A][X]

##TailtiuAzelleTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadAzelle][OpenMidLeft][LoadTailtiu]
Hey, Azelle?[N]
Wait up a sec.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Tailtiu?[N]
Is something wrong?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I need to ask you something quick.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm?[N]
Me?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah. That okay?[N]
I mean, we've been friends for years.[A][N]
And I don't think there's anyone else who[N]
I can ask about this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh. You look downright grim and serious[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
If you really think I can help, then sure.[N]
What seems to be the problem?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I, er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I'm only with you lot because I was just[N]
following Claud around,[A][N]
but I'm starting to think[N]
I shouldn't have done that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What makes you think so?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's because people are acting kinda like[N]
they're treading carefully 'round me.[A][N]
And when I'm around, people stop talking[N]
about my father[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] That certainly doesn't sound fun.[N]
But I'd say people really do like you.[A][N]
It's more that they honestly aren't sure how[N]
they should treat you, and that they're worried[A][N]
they'll cause you grief.[N]
Don't worry too much.[A][N]
It'll all be fine once they get to know you better.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Guess you're right. Thanks, Azelle.[N]
Think I might be feeling a bit better 'bout this now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hah! Glad you're back to normal, Tailtiu.[N]
If you're ever feeling like this again,[A][N] 
I'll always be here to help you through it,[N]
no matter what happens.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Okay![N]
Thanks![A][X]

##SilviaErinysTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadErinys][OpenMidLeft][LoadSilvia]
Hey! Hey, Erin! You totally like Lewyn, don't ya?[N]
Like, do ya really like him?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Huh?! I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] that's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Er, no.[A][N]
Prince Lewyn is beloved and respected by all[N]
the people of Silesse, myself included.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh? Okay then. Then I guess you'd be okay with[N]
me and Lewyn getting together, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er,[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Yes.[N]
I wouldn't really mind[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][OpenMidLeft]
Reeeeally?[N]
That wouldn't bug ya at all?[N][A][OpenMidRight]
No, I'm sure I'd have no issue.[N]
Wy do ask? Am I supposed to object?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I dunno! But if it's all fine by ya, then I guess[N]
it's time for me to go work my magic on Lewyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The thing is, a prospective queen of Silesse ought[N]
to possess the same grace and dignity as our Queen Lahna.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, so you're sayin' I'm not cut for it?[N]
How rude![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That isn't-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hmph. Fine, then![N]
I'll show you![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##EdainAzelleLoveTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadAzelle][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
Take care of yourself out here, Azelle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Right.[N]
And you as well, Edain.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
This still feels so odd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Not once did I ever[N]
think that one day we would be together like this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's because I'm younger than you, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, no.[N]
I'm still not sure why[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I still can't quite believe it, either![A][N]
That you're now my wife[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It all still[N]
feels like I'm living in some kind of dream![N][A][OpenMidLeft]
Hm? How so?[N]
Don't you believe our marriage feels right?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's not that.[N]
It's because, er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, you're so beautiful[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Even though I was still very young,[A][N]
when I saw you for the first time years  ago,[N]
my heart just wouldn't stop pounding![A][N]
Ever since that day, you were the only one[N]
for whom I've ever felt this way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, Azelle[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's still pretty embarassing to admit[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Oh, I almost forgot! This is for you.[A][N]
This is a Rescue staff. You can use it to bring[N]
people far away back to your side instantly.[A][N]
I know you'll put it to good use.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm so happy to be with you, Azelle.[A][N]
I'll always treasure having such a kind[N]
and gentle soul as you by my side[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##EdainMidirLoveTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadMidir][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
Midir, please accept this bow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Isn't this a brave bow? Are you sure[N]
you want to give away something so rare?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I am. I bought it for you, after all.[N]
Silesse's pegasus knights are a formidable foe to face.[A][N]
With a bow of this caliber in hand,[N]
I know you'll be better prepared to fight them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Milady[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I still can't believe this isn't a dream![A][N]
I can't believe we're actually married[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I've dreamed of this for so long.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I've long dreamt of the same myself.[A][N]
I had wanted to act upon it for so many years,[N]
but I couldn't, even at my loneliest[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I think by now you can just call me Edain.[N]
I'll always look out for you, Midir.[A][N]
I'll always pray for your safety.[A][X]

##EdainJamkeLoveTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadJamke][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
Jamke, I'd like you to have this bow.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
This is a brave bow, isn't it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You sure it's okay for me to take it?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes.[N]
Please, accept it.[A][N]
As formidable as the Silessian pegasus knights are,[N]
so long you have this bow,[A][N]
I know you'll have the upper hand.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thanks, Edain. I know I'll be able[N]
to keep you safe with a bow like this.[A][N]
I guess I'll see you later, once this is all over.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Jamke[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'll be praying for your safety.[A][X]

The Tofa army's attacking?[N]
Look like Myos has finally made his move.[A][N]
Heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] Why, this drama is finally[N]
getting interesting. Wouldn't you say, Pamela?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed, sir. However, as I recall we didn't[N]
account for Sigurd's fugitives being here.[A][N]
Their strength poses a real risk to the plan.[A][N]
If Myos at least succeeds in weakening them,
perhaps Silesse's fall will go smoothly?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Even if he fails, I still have my private deal.[N]
with Grannvale in my favor.[A][N]
Their Lord Andrey should arrive shortly[N]
with a battalion of reinforcements.[A][N]
Heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] My victory is certain, Pamela![A][N]
I'll be sitting on the Silessian throne[N]

Sire, the Tofa village elder[N]
would like a word with you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. Actually, I'd imagine we need[N]
to talk this situation over. Bring him in.[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadMan5]
Lord Sigurd, I presume?[A][N]
We can't thank you enough[N]
for getting rid of Lord Myos.[A][N]
The entire population of Thove is[N]
rejoicing at his downfall![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm? Are you sure?[A][N]
I mean, I just conquered you.[N]
Am I not the enemy here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Myos was nothing but a tyrant.[N]
All he ever did was bleed us dry.[A][N]
You fight in the name of Queen Lahna,[N]
and there isn't a Silessian alive who doesn't[A][N]
bear the utmost adoration for our queen.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so? Thank you.[A][N]
Anyway, in the interim I think I'll leave[N]
governing Tofa to you, sir.[A][N]
Once the crisis has settled, the queen will[N]
be in touch to arrange a proper successor.[A][N]
Until then, I'm sure you'll be a just governor[N]
to help heal Tofa's wounds.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Very well.[A][N]
Please, Lord Sigurd, do all you can to[N]
protect the queen. She is a treasure to us,[A][N]
and a beacon of peace and kindness.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Well, er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I'm not sure how to put this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You're wearing nothing but smallclothes.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Eh?! Watch your mouth, mister Father![N]
Haven't you seen dancers like me before?[A][N]
This is just a dancer's clothes.[N]
It's just like you wearin' your churchy cloak![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hm. Surely you're chilled to the bone,[N]
wearing as little as you are, though?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, no! Even 'round here I'm never cold,[N]
'cause my heart's ablaze![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is dancing truly fun for you?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah! I just love it![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What of your parents?[N]
Do they agree with this career of yours?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Actually, I'm an orphan.[A][N]
When I was really little, my master took me in[N]
and helped me become a dancer.[A][N]
But he[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] he was an awful, awful man.[N]
He'd always beat me outta nowhere.[A][N]
'Bout a year ago I couldn't stand any more[N]
of it all, so I ran away.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What a horrible tale.[A][N]
I believe I know your pain.[A][N]
I once had a sister, Valeria, who would likely[N]
be around your age if she's still alive.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
A sister?[N][A][OpenMidRight]
Yes. Alas, she was abducted while she[N]
was still an infant.[A][N]
I've searched for her ever since,[N]
but to this day I've yet to find any sign of her.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ohh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I bet she's just like a princess![N]
She's gotta be all pretty and classy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And nothin' like me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I disagree. I assure you, I do find you[N]
to be utterly charming. In your own way,[A][N]
you possess a unique grace and beauty.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] mister Father[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] really?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[N]
I could never lie.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Th-thank you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Nobody's ever told me soemthin' like that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
This feels kinda funny somehow[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]

##ZaxonAttacks
[OpenMidRight][LoadPamela][OpenMidLeft][LoadDaccar]
Tofa has fallen, has it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I almost feel bad for my brother:[N]
little more than a pawn in my dreams[A][N]
who'd outlived his usefulness.[A][N]
Pamela, it's your turn.[N]
Lead your pegasus knights into battle at once![A][N]

Yes, sir![A][X]

##AnnandEntersTheFray
[OpenMidRight][LoadLahna][OpenMidLeft][LoadAnnand]
Dire news, milady![A][N]
Zaxon has deployed Pamela's pegasus unit[N]
and they're closing in on the capital![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?! This can't be happening![A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So, at long last, Daccar has put to rest[N]
his tired old façade of innocence.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Be at ease, milady.[N]
My squad will keep Pamela's at bay.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Annand, are you sure you can do this?[A][N]
I've heard stories of the sheer terror[N]
of Pamela's might as a warrior.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I know better than to take lightly[N]
such a formidable foe.[A][N]
But remember, I am one of the[N]
Four Heavenly Knights of Silesse.[A][N]
I never enter a battle ill prepared.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm so sorry, Annand.[A][N]
I already know well how you feel about all this,[N]
but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
To fight in your name is the only life I know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Milady, please. Don't worry about me so much.[A][N]
If that's all, then, I'll be going.[N]
Knights, to me! Move out![A][X]

##AndreyArrives

Ah, Duke Andrey, I presume?[N]
You certainly took your time getting here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Oh! How magnificent![N]
So this is Yngvi's renowned bow knight legion![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hmhmhm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Alas, my father is dead,[N]
and my sister is a fugutive among the traitors.[A][N]
This leaves me, and me alone,[N]
as the Duke of Yngvi and leader of our legion![A][N]
Against the might of the Beige Ritter,[N]
these winged ponies stand no chance at all![A][N]
Now, sit back and watch them drop like flies![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadAnnand]
It's been a while, Pamela[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I've known you for years, ever since[N]
we trained side by side to become knights.[A][N]
But not once did I ever suspect we would[N]
someday find ourselves as enemies.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPamela]
Annand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Only you would be so foolish[N]
as to insist on following your queen[N]
to her inevitable grave![A][N]
Why should I complain, though?[N]
After all, once you're out of the way,[N]
that leaves me as the greatest knight of Silesse![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAnnand]
The only fool here is you, Pamela![N]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It's too late to change your mind.[A][N]
You're so set on your fate[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Very well.[N]
All I can do for you now is give you a last[N]
honorable duel befitting a Silessian knight.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadPamela]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

This can't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##AndreyMoves
[OpenMidRight][LoadPamela][OpenMidLeft][LoadAndrey]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I expected so much more from[N]
Silesse's famous pegasus knights[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
No matter. I suppose we might as well[N]
bring down the capital while we're here.[A][N]
Pamela, your unit will cross the mountains.[N]
Beseige and capture Tofa immediately.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well.[A][X]

##AndreyRetreats

Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] At long last.[N]
The capital is mine, and mine alone![A][N]
Now, I want a wind mage unit deployed south[N]
of Silesse River. Fortify our defensive line there.[A][N]
Furthermore[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Donovan![A][N]
You and your axemen are to occupy the capital[N]
and maintain its defenses.[A][N]
But don't even think about killing the queen.[N]
We can't waste a hostage of such high value.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Got it, sir![A][X]

Get out there and butcher those little pigs![A][N]
No survivors![N]

No! Please, stop![N]
My citizens are as innocent as they come![A][N]
It matters not what happens to me,[N]
but please, don't harm my people![A][N][OpenMidRight]
I don't think so. You've been screwin' up[N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadLamia][OpenMidLeft][LoadDaccar]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] It appears leaving this to Donovan[N]
was a good idea after all.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, now! It's been a long time since[N]
I've seen such daring villainy anywhere![A][N]
It's almost enough to turn a weaker stomach.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Coming from someone like you, willing to kill[N]
anyone, anywhere, anytime as long as you're[A][N]
handsomely paid, that's quite a claim.[A][N]
High praise indeed, if it's from the lips[N]
of the infamous "Ice Empress".[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ohoho![ToggleSmile] Quite the flatterer, aren't you?[N]
Now, where do we begin with our mayhem?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
For now, your group will guard the castle.[A][N]
Be ready to roll out your traditional welcome[N]
in case Sigurd's thugs try causing us grief.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Guard duty? Really? Where's the fun in that?[N]
Eh, no matter. It's your money.[A][N]
Oi, ladies! Listen up![A][N]
We're on guard duty. Stick to the castle,[N]
and pick the enemy's leftovers if they come![A][X]

##DonovanAttacks
Huh? So the Sailane army's finally comin'? Good![N]

Your Highness! I'm so glad you're unharmed.[N]
My sincerest apologies for not coming to your aid sooner.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
It's fine, Lord Sigurd.[N]
That you've made it here is more than enough.[A][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm sorry I couldn't do more.[A][N]
Too many people have died, and I could only[N]

And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and Annand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Don't worry, Your Highness.[N]
Annand's killers will die this day by my hand.[A][N]
Daccar's crimes are beyond forgiveness.[N]
I promise you: he will not escape me.[A][N]
With this in mind, I humbly request[N]
your authorization to assault Zaxon Castle.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lord Daccar's petty greed has condemned[N]
my people to utter agony long enough.[A][N]
He is a murderer. Nothing more, nothing less.[N]
You may visit justice upon him, Lord Sigurd.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Understood.[N]
I'll mobilize my army to capture Zaxon immediately.[A][N]
For now, Your Highness, please get some rest.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Instruct Lamia to move out and attack at once![A][N]

Hey, Sigurd?[N]
Could I have a word?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, Lewyn.[N]
I'm so sorry about what happened to Annand.[A][N]
I had no idea Yngvi's bow knights[N]
would get involved in this mess.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No, it's not your fault.[N]
Just mine[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I just haven't been thinking right lately.[A][N]
I should've been here all along,[N]
looking after Mother and the country.[A][N]
But nope, I just ran away![A][N]
That's why Annand died[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
She just took my place in all this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's no need to blame yourself.[A][N]
The best you can do now is care for the queen,[N]
and ensure that Annand didn't die in vain.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, I know.[N]
No use pointing out the obvious, huh?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well.[N]
Oh, Lewyn, before I forget[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Don't forget to go see your mother[N]

When I heard that Silesse had fallen, I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I was pretty worried there.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you so much for coming, Lewyn.[A][N]
Perhaps at last, you've matured into a young man[N]
who honors his promises.[A][N][ToggleSmile]
Perhaps Lord Sigurd has had quite the[N]
positive influence on you after all.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, come on, Mother![N]
You don't need to act like I'm still a child.[A][N]
Besides, Sigurd is hardly all that much older[N]
than I am.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Dear, compared to the likes of Lord Sigurd,[N]
you may as well still be a screaming infant.[A][N]
You've still much to learn from him, and quickly.[A][N]
Nothing would be more reassuring than[N]
having a son as fine as he by my side.[A][N]
Especially now that Annand is[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Annand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I should have been the one to die out there.[N]
Not her. If only I'd gotten here sooner![A][N]
Mother, I'll be here to protect you from now on.[N]
I won't let Annand's death go to waste.[A][N]
I swear, I will never, ever leave you again.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh, Lewyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I never thought you were capable[N]
of saying anything so kind.[A][N]
But your word is more than enough.[A][N]
For now, at least, I believe you should[N]
remain at Lord Sigurd's side.[A][N]
He has a greater need of your strength.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But if I do that, what about you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
There's nothing to worry about, Lewyn.[N]
You are the heir of the wind crusader, Ced.[A][N]
Your place is with the rest of the world,[N]
to lead and guide it on its true parth.[A][N]
The time has come for me[N]
to confer upon you your true birthright[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
The exalted wind tome, Foresti.[A][N]
Here, Lewyn,[N]
It's yours.[A][N][ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]
This[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] So this is the royal family's[N]
ancestral tome[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The Book of Foresti[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Oh! This power[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] What's this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] warmth?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Lewyn, never forget:[N]
the wind Crusader flows as the gentlest breeze.[A][N]
His way is to guide all the peoples of the world[N]
on the path of peace.[A][N]
Hate and violence is never his answer.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, of course.[N]
I don't think I could live my life any other way.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

Perhaps you truly are a child of the wind[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Magic is governed by a hierarchy of power,[N]
just like weapons.[A][N]
Fire magic bests wind, wind bests thunder,[N]
and thunder bests fire.[A][N]
However, dark and light magic have[N]
an advantage over all of the others.[A][N]
Think your strategies through with care.[A][X]

##C4_1VillageTwo
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan5]
Bein' of holy ancestry can bestow[N]

'Course, it's not every day you meet someone[N]

##C4_1VillageThree

Only a direct holy descendant can inherit[N]
the full breadth of the power of the gods.[A][N]
And only they'll be able to wield[N]
their family's divine heirlooms.[A][N]
However, if kin intersect, their[N]
offspring'll have their exalted[A][N]

Should Prince Kurth's daughter bear a son,[N]

The sinister powers of the dark god Loptous[N]

It's been so long since we've had time[N]
for respite or fun[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]

##C4_2VillageTwoDrawbridgeOff
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadMan2]
Y'know how there's a drawbridge over[N]
the Tofa River?[A][N]
Yeah, that's under the control of[N]
Duke Myos, too.[A][N]
If it's still drawn and you don't have the key,[N]
you're not getting across.[A][N]
Mind you, if you have a thief's sticky fingers[N]
at your service, that might not be a problem[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##C4_2VillageTwoDrawbridgeOn

##SeizingZaxon
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadOifey]
Sire, Queen Lahna has arrived.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadLahna]
Lord Sigurd, that was quite the fierce battle,[N]
wasn't it? Are you unharmed?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah.[N]
Somehow, I'm okay.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I know I've asked so much of you already,[N]
Lord Sigurd, but would you and your army[A][N]
please station yourselves here at Zaxon?[A][N]
Grannvale's Lord Lombard has already[N]
swept in with an immense army and[A][N]
conquered Lubeck Castle, to our east.[A][N]
The people of Silesse are terrified that this will prove[N]
to be but a prelude to a full-scale war with Grannvale.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your Highness, I believe Lombard's army is[N]
here only for me.[A][N]
I've no desire to needlessly endanger you[N]
or your citizens, after all you've done for us.[A][N]
My men and I are leaving. Now.[N]
I have a score to settle with Lombard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What recklessness![N]
How could you possibly prevail like this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They're coming for me no matter what.[N]
If we remain here, then they'll just invade.[A][N]
We can't afford to waste time debating this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Is that so[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
How sad[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your Highness[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thank you so much.[A][N]
You've given me the most wonderful year here,[N]
and you've done so much to put my mind at ease.[A][N]
My mother died when I was still very young,[N]
so as I grew up,[A][N]
I never knew the unconditional love of a mother[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But thanks to you, here in Silesse,[N]
I've come to know that very same warmth.[A][N]
You're like a second mother to me know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Take care of yourself, Your Highness.[A][N]
I hope that someday, once this is all over,[N]
we'll have a chance to meet again.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
As do I, Lord Sigurd.[A][N]
Please, stay vigilant out there, and keep[N]
yourself safe.[A][N]
From the bottom of my heart,[N]
I pray that you and Deirdre will soon be reunited.[A][X]
