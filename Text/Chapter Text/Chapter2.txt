##ImcaDied
[OpenMidRight][LoadLachesis][OpenMidLeft][LoadEldigan]
Lachesis, I'm leaving for Agusti.[A][N]
I can't rest until I've convinced King Chagall[N]
to end his foolish warmongering.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Please don't do it, brother![A][N]
You know as well as I that Chagall[N]
murdered his father himself.[A][N]
You'll only be endangering yourself[N]
for a lost cause.[A][N]
He won't listen to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You mustn't say such things about your king![A][N]
I, too, have heard the rumors of King Chagall's[N]
involvement, but they are just that:rumors.[A][N]
There remains no evidence against him.[A][N]
Surely, His Majesty will see reason in this matter,[N]
if I simply persuade him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Enough![A][N]
I'll leave three of my finest knights here to[N]
defend Nordion, should the worst come to pass.[A][N]
Lachesis, you needn't look so sad.[N]
I will be back. I promise.[A][N]
I'm not about to abandon you in death.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

##ChagallMustStop
[OpenMidRight][LoadChagall][OpenMidLeft][LoadEldigan]
Please, Your Majesty![N]
Reconsider your militant ambitions.[A][N]
Your father before you worked so hard[N]
to build an era of peace with Grannvale.[A][N]
A war will only bring ruin to our people,[N]
bringing disgrace upon your good name[A][N]
for generations to come.[A][N]
I implore you: do not start a war![A][N][OpenMidRight]
So it's you[...] Eldigan of Nordion.[A][N]
You dastard[...] My father adored you, and you[N]
used his trust to undercut me at every turn.[A][N]
But now, my father is no more[...][N]
And long live the king of all Agustria![A][N]
For years you've made me play the fool,[N]
and now, I will reward you in kind.[A][N]
Guards! Throw this man in the dungeon![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
W-wait![N]
Your Majesty, please-[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Pfeh![N]
Good riddance, the eyesore.[A][N]
Send my orders to Bordeaux at Heirhein:[N]
seize Nordion Castle![A][N]
Once that nuisance is dealt with,[N]
we're clear to throw all we've got at Grannvale![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadManfroy]
Your Majesty, King Chagall[...][N]
I see you've made your decision at last.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Manfroy? Yes, just as we agreed.[N]
Father is dead, and by my hand.[A][N]
[...]There is no turning back now. Even so,[N]
I still don't know if we stand a chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Remember, Grannvale still adheres to that[N]
tawdry old peace treaty with you,[A][N]
and their entire army is distracted in Isaach.[A][N]
Strike now, and you could not possibly fail.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're right.[A][N]
The downfall of Grannvale will mark the rise[N]
of Agustria as Jugdral's new leading power![A][N]
"Chagall, Emperor of the World"[...][N]
I like the sound of that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hmhmhm[...][ToggleSmile][N]
We can only hope your ambition will be rewarded.[A][X]

##EldiganMissingEve
[OpenMidRight][LoadLachesis][OpenMidLeft][LoadEve]
Lady Lachesis! We haven't[N]

The status of Lord Eldigan[N]

No! I knew I shouldn't[N]

they won't hesitate to[N]
attack us with their might.[A][N]
I'm sure they are not pleased[N]
with what happened in Verdane.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

fact that I want nothing with him![A][N]
I can't stand conceited men[N]

Rest assured, my brothers and I will do[N]

Even after what happened[N]
to Eve[...][A][N]
I haven't heard anything[N]

Not to worry. Eldigan picked[N]

Yes, father?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eldigan is busy at Agusty.[A][N]
There's no doubt he'll anger the new[N]

Brilliant! At once, father![A][X]

##BordeauxCommandsGraham

Eldigan is busy at Agusty.[A][N]
There's no doubt he'll anger the new[N]

At once, your majesty.[N]

##BackAtNordion
[OpenMidRight][LoadLachesis][OpenMidLeft][LoadEve]
Milady![A][N]
We've received word that Lord Eldigan[N]
was arrested in Agusti![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?![N]
You must be joking![A][N]
Oh[...] Why didn't I try harder[...][N]
I shouldn't have let him go[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That isn't our only problem, milady.[A][N]
With Lord Eldigan gone,[N]
we need to be aware of Heirhein's movements.[A][N]
Knowing of his lordship's absence,[N]
a strike from them is inevitable.[A][N]
After the Verdane incident,[N]
they're most likely out for revenge on us[...][A][N]
Especially after the death of Lord Elliot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ugh, that Elliot[...][A][N]
I can't believe how many times I've had to tell him[N]
I'm not interested in him.[A][N]
Smug, self-absorbed swine like him are the[N]
absolute worst![A][N]
If only more men were cut[N]
from the same cloth as Eldie[...][A][N]
It's too bad they aren't, else perhaps someone[N]
would stand a chance to marry me.[A][N]
Perhaps.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Er[...] Be that as it may, Lord Eldigan's[N]
Cross Knights are still dispatched to the[A][N]
north at Fort Sylvale, well away from here.[A][N]
We three are all who remain.[N]
Nordion is vulnerable, and they know it.[A][N]
Rest assured, my brothers and I will do[N]
all we can to defend the castle,[A][N]
but the odds are against us.[N]
I'm sorry milady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Thank you, Yves.[N]
But please, look after yourselves.[A][N]
Don't waste your lives for me.[A][N]
Be sure to tell Eva and Alva[N]
that I'm sorry for this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We are not worthy of such kind words, milady.[A][N]
Even so, Lord Eldigan handpicked us[N]
to defend you.[A][N]
Our lord gave us a task,[N]
and we will see it through.[A][N]
As paladins of Nordion, our lives are yours,[N]
no matter what.[A][N]
To our dying breaths, we live to defend you![A][X]

##HeirheinAttacks
[OpenFarRight][LoadPhillip][OpenRight][LoadGraham][OpenMidLeft][LoadBordeaux]
Let me get this straight.[A][N]
Eldigan ticked off the king and got himself[N]
a little prison time for his troubles?[A][N]
Ahahaha, that's perfect![ToggleSmile][N]
Graham! Phillip! Lay siege to Nordion at once![A][N]
Let's see some tears roll down Eldigan's cheeks![A][N][OpenFarRight]
At once, Your Majesty.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight]
We won't disappoint you, sir.[A][X]

##NordionUnderAttack
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadOifey]
Sire, we have trouble![A][N]
It appears that Lord Eldigan has been[N]
taken prisoner and Nordion is under attack.[A][N]
I bear a message from Lady Lachesis,[N]
pleading for aid.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They've taken Eldigan?![A][N]
Why[...] Why in the world would they treat a man[N]
so esteemed this way?[A][N]
Inform everybody to make ready.[N]
We ride for Nordion at once![A][N]
No matter the cost, Lachesis needs us.[A][N]
He might never admit it, but[N]
Lachesis has always been dear to Eldigan.[A][N]
The loss of Lachesis would gravely wound him[...][A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadDeirdre]
Milord[...][N]
You're preparing for another battle, aren't you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry Deirdre.[N]
I owe so much to Eldigan.[A][N]
I could never abandon his sister in a time like this.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I thought as much. I'm not about to stop you.[N]
No[...] I will accompany you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?![N]
No, I can't allow that![A][N]
I refuse to endanger you like this.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Milord, do you not remember our vows?[A][N]
You swore to never leave my side, and[...][N]
I[...] I am[...] uneasy[...][A][N]
I have a feeling that if you and I were to part,[N]
we would never find each other again[...][A][N]
Please, grant me this. Let me stay by your side[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry[...] you're right. I did promise.[N]
Very well! Let us ride together.[A][N]
But you mustn't leave my side.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I won't.[A][X]

##Holynisnotamused
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHolyn]
Is that all there is?[A][N]
Not even the Gladiators of Agustria[N]
can fill my desire for a challenge.[A][N]
I heard the Grannvelian army is[N]

They conquered all of Verdane.[N]
They must have some fine fighters.[A][N]

The way you fought[...][N]
You were brimming with spirit![A][N]
Hm[...] I'd wager there's something[N]
you're here to fight for, right?[A][N]
All I've done is chase the money for all[N]
these years[...][A][N]
But I look at you, and suddenly,[N]
it all feels so meaningless.[A][N]
Hey, I don't suppose you're recruiting?[A][N]
Maybe using my blade for something real[N]

##EthlynDeirdreTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadDeirdre][OpenMidLeft][LoadEthlyn]
How are you faring so far, Deirdre?[A][N]
I know my brother is worried something fierce[N]

Everything will be alright. I can feel it.[A][N]
So long as I'm at Sigurd's side,[N]

I don't think I've ever seen Sigurd as happy[N]
as he's been since he met you.[A][N]
He's pratically a changed man![A][N][OpenMidRight]

I've been meaning to give[N]
it to you for a while.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

Wow[...] These are so rare and hard to come by![A][N]
Are you sure you want to give me this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]

She's been playing cruel games[N]

But look how the tables have turned![A][N]
I've an entire army behind me, against[N]

What could she possibly do?[A][N]

Hmmm[...] I can't just stand[N]

allow these people to suffer.[A][N]

Your wishes are orders, sir![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Under the old king, you couldn't even dare[N]

Didn't you thought the Grannvalians[N]
fought with good intentions?[A][N]
Maybe they won't retaliate[N]
if we don't attack them first[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yet, we can't disobey our[N]

and of Chagall's hand in it.[A][N]
He's received word of Chagall's ambitions[N]

Well, well! The bard's still here, are you?[A][N]
You oughta get outta here.[N]
We(ve got bandits headed our way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Bandits,[A][N]
Isn't the Agustrian army doing something[N]
about them?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The army?[ToggleSmile] Hah! That's rich, boy![A][N]
The army's too busy with their little civil war[N]
to deal with our problems.[A][N] 
Clearly that's more important than our safety.[N]
Actually, that's not all[...][ToggleSmile][A][N]
Rumor is, the Lord of Infini himself[N]

Things'll probably get more than a bit[N]

Lewyn, I presume?[A][N]
The one who's been helping defend the villages?[N]
I appreciate the aid.[A][N]
As I understand it, you're a bard,[N]
but you also wield magic?[A][N]
That's unusual.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Something like that.[N]
I guess it's a hobby.[A][N]
You're that Sigurd fellow, aren't you?[N]
It's obvious what yours is: war![A][N]
Clearly you've got so much spare time,[N]
you spend it starting war after war![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Come again?[N]
You seem angry, but-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't play dumb![A][N]
Think about the people of all the countries[N]
that you're flattening![A][N]
You come barging in, swords flashing,[N]
and all you do is ruin the lives of normal folk[A][N]
who're trying to make a living here![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're right. My apologies, Lewyn[...][A][N]
I didn't even think about that,[N]
but I can't stand knowing I've done this to them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Words are just words without actions[N]
backing them up.[A][N]
If you really feel so bad, then why not[N]
pull your army out?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm, you're right[...] Very well.[N]
I'll consult with my troops and arrange a retreat.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, you're serious about this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I've been mulling over retreating[N]
for a while already, and you just gave me[A][N]
the answer to all of this.[A][N]
I've had enough of the war approach.[N]
I think I'd rather seek a diplomatic answer.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, no.[A][N]
Trying to get through to Chagall now[N]
would be a total waste of everyone's time.[A][N]
Besides, if you lot pull out now,[N]
then nothing stands between a peeved king[A][N]
and all the citizens who've helped you so far.[A][N]
Are you sure you're okay with leaving them[N]
all hanging like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

##SeizingInfini
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadOifey]
Sire, we have a visitor.[N]
Lord Rodan of Edda seeks an audience.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadRodan][OpenMidRight]
Lord Rodan, I presume?[N]
Thank you for coming.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Sigurd, the Agustrian conflict[N]
has escalated into full-scale war, I see.[A][N]
How does this battle look at the moment?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We're faring well so far, somehow,[N]
but this hasn't been easy by any means.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Incidentally, Lord Sigurd,[N]
I regret to say that I come bearing bad news[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's happened?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nasty rumors have emerged of late[N]
in the royal court[...] and they concern you.[A][N]
The rumors claim that, in concert with[N]
Quan of Leonster and Eldigan of Nordion,[A][N]
you are conspiring against the crown.[A][N]
This, it is said, is why you are harboring[N]
the prince of Isaach in your ranks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?! That's absurd![N]
Who in the world could've started such nonsense[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Chancellor Reptor and Duke Lombard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[...] I should have known,[N]
knowing their disdain for my father.[A][N]
Yet, to take that grudge so far[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Those two are ruled by their envy of[N]
your father's immense power as[A][N]
Prince Kurth's advisor, I'd say.[A][N]
They likely believe a Chalphy-controlled prince[N]
will strip them of their influence[A][N]
once he takes the throne.[A][N]
Fear and jealousy dominate their lives[...][N]
Don't let your guard down against them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, sir. I appreciate the warning.[A][N]
By the way, sir[...] Pray tell, how goes the[N]
Isaachian campaign? Is there an end in sight?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It seems there is indeed, from what we've heard.[A][N]
We expect the triumphant return of[N]
the prince and your father any day now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank the gods Prince Kurth is safe.[A][N]
Losing him to this war would have dealt[N]
such a blow to Grannvale's future[...][A][N]
I know my fater worries so about how[N]
the Belhalla lineage would end with[A][N]
His Majesty's death, unmarried as he is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed.[A][N]
Before the war started, we were trying[N]
to hasten him to search for a wife.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If I may, is there a problem?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed[...] The story behind this has been well[N]
known in the royal court for a long time now.[A][N]
Regrettably, His Highness struggles to move on[N]
from a long-lost love.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Really?[N]
Why did he never marry this person?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well[...][N]
Perhaps I ought to tell you the complete tale.[A][N]
This happened some twenty years ago.[A][N]
Prince Kurth had an affair with[N]
the duchess of Velthomer,[A][N]
a truly lovely woman as I recall.[A][N]
Duke Victor of Velthomer was[...][A][N]
Well, he was a philanderer of the worst degree,[N]
and had countless lovers.[A][N]
The prince, of course, is nothing like him.[A][N]
He wished only to support the duchess at first,[N]
but the two soon fell deeply in love.[A][N]
Victor was distraught, needless to say.[A][N]
He penned a letter denouncing the pair,[N]
then he took his own life.[A][N]
The duchess could bear to stay no longer.[N]
She fled Grannvale and was never seen again.[A][N]
As I recall, her name was Cigyun.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Wow. That's horrible[...][N]
So she was the mother of Lord Arvis[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed.[N]
I can scarcely imagine what this was like for him[...][A][N]
Losing both parents at only the age of seven[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Mm. And yet, I feel sorry for the prince.[N]
Not to mention, for Cigyun as well[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh! My apologies.[A][N]
I'm sure a soldier of your caliber has better things[N]
to worry about than court gossip.[A][N]
Please, don't worry about the story.[N]
You have a war with Agustria to win, after all![A][N]
Farewell, Lord Sigurd. We look forward to the day[N]
that you, too, return to the fatherland in triumph.[A][X]

##MackilyMobilizes

Are they just going to keep going[N]
until all Agustria is theirs?[A][N]
They'll have to come this way.[N]

Ah, Elling, what is it?[A][N]
I trust you've noticed we're currently[N]
contending with a Grannvale invasion?[A][N]
They have taken Prince Lewyn captive![A][N]
I have reports that their army is arresting[N]
and executing anyone and anything[A][N]
which stands in their way.[A][N]
Lewyn is being held in the[N]
forests near Mackily. We gotta hurry![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No[...] I can't allow this![A][N]
Thank you for your assistance.[N]
We'll leave to rescue him at once.[A][N]
Our queen, Lahna, cautioned us aginst[N]
clashing with other nations on our mission,[A][N]
but we may have no choice.[A][N]
Should Grannvale's troops cross our way,[N]
they'll be confronted without hesitation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oho[...][ToggleSmile] This is even better than I'd hoped![N]
Best of luck on your hunt.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

We've been informed that Agusti still holds[N]

How in the blazes will you fix this?![A][N]
Heh heh[...][ToggleSmile] You exaggerate my role.[A][N]
All I did was advise the removal of the king,[N]

All else was your choice.[N]

Manfroy, I'm begging you[...] Help me.[N]

As I said, this isn't over.[A][N]
As a last resort, I do believe you have[N]
a fellow of use imprisoned here[...][A][N]
Yes, I speak of Eldigan.[A][N]
Eldigan and Sigurd have been associates[N]
for years.[A][N]
Sigurd will unquestionably listen[N] 
to Eldigan's counsel.[A][N]
Of course, Eldigan can't do that[N]
while locked up, can he?[A][N]
Go apologize to him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Er[...] Y-yes, of course![N] 
Surely, Eldigan is the answer![A][N]
Now, if you'll excuse me[...][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]

Your Excellency, I bear news from the east.[A][N]
Just now, we received confirmation of[N]
the assassination of Prince Kurth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so? Excellent.[ToggleSmile][A][N]
This grows more interesting,[N]
if I do say so myself.[A][N]
With Kurth's death there remains[N]
but a single scion to Naga's holy lineage,[N]
and that old fool hardly needs our help to die.[A][N]
And then, all that will remain is[N]
the restoration of the dark one,[A][N]
and then the world will belong to us[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What of Duke Arvis, Your Excellency?[N]
Is he in agreement with your plan?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why, of course.[A][N]
As a bearer of the dark one's blood,[N]
what choice does he have?[A][N]
Not even one of Arvis's stature can[N]
afford the wider world learning of his[A][N]
dark heritage, lest he be burned at the stake.[A][N]
Could a man as prideful as Arvis[N]
bear to meet such an end?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So he will betray his king and style[N]
himself emperor, and[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed[...] But that will not be enough.[A][N]
Arvis alone cannot restore the dark god.[A][N]
We still need one more person[...][N]

But why, milord[...][A][N]
Aren't you supposed to be held captive at Evans?[N]
I got here as fast as I could, but[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm imprisoned at Evans, am I?[N]
Where'd you hear that one?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
King Chagall of Agustria said so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Chagall? Hah![ToggleSmile][A][N]
Hate to break it to you, Erin,[N]
but you've been tricked![A][N]
It's nice and all that[N]
you're so ready to trust,[A][N]
but you wouldn't last ten seconds[N]
out there in the city![A][N]
It'd eat you and your innocence alive.[ToggleSmile][N]
You might even end up like Silvia[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]

Oh, Silvia's[...] Er, it's not important.[A][N]
Point is, what are you doing[N]
all the way out here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Isn't it obvious?[N]
I'm here to find and bring you home, milord.[A][N]
It's been two years since you fled Silesse.[N]
Her Majesty is gravely worried about you.[A][N]
Please, milord.[N]
Come home with me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do you have any idea what that'd do[N]
to Silesse, Erin?[A][N]
If I go back,[N]
I'll have no choice but to take the throne.[A][N]
It's my late father's will, but my uncles[N]
would never accept it.[A][N]
Just one false step and we'd have[N]
a civil war, just like here.[A][N]
And it's always the common folk[N]
who suffer for it![A][N]
If there are people who want[N]
to be kings or whatever, great![A][N]
Out here, though?[N]
I'm free, and I like it that way.[A][N]
I don't want a thing to do with that throne.[A][N]
For the good of Silesse,[N]
just give it to one of my uncles.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't allow that milord.[A][N]
You know as well as I that kings of Silesse[N]
must bear descent from Forseti, the wind god.[A][N]
You, milord, are the sole living[N]
scion of his lineage.[A][N]
Neither of your uncles bear it.[A][N]
You milord, are Silesse's future![A][N]
Yourself and your uncles aside,[N]
all Silesse wishes to see you claim the throne.[A][N]
And[...] And your mother, the queen,[N]
was in tears when she sent me[...][A][N]
Please, milord[...] Come back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Erin[...][N]
Ugh, don't you start crying too![A][N]
Give me a break[...][N]
I can't stand to see a woman in tears[...][A][N]
Okay, fine. I'll think about going home.[A][N]
Just[...] Give me some time[N]
to muster the nerve, alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you.[A][N]
In that case, I'm staying with you until[N]
you're ready, milord.[A][N]
I'll send a messenger back to Silesse[N]
to report that you're safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wow, you're persistent, I'll grant you that.[N]
All right.[A][N]
I think I'll stay with Sigurd's army for now.[A][N]
He's a pretty neat guy to work with,[N]
not to mention his army's full of beauties![ToggleSmile][A][N]
Hey, Erin, you could stand to get to[N]

It's hardly my business, anyway.[A][N]

none of this makes sense to me, either.[A][N]
As if out of nowhere, the entirety of[N]
Agustria suddenly turned against us.[A][N]
We had no choice.[A][N]
I've been ordered to remain here with my army[N]
for the time being, to maintain peace and order.[A][N]
Eldigan, please.[A][N]
I know this is a dreadful situation,[N]
but one year is all I need.[A][N]
I can restore the country's peace to normal[N]
and repair our diplomatic ties,[A][N]
but only if I'm allowed time to do it.[A][N]
Once our time is through,[N]
we'll leave your country with no objections.[A][N]
My king and I pledge our word.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Hm[...] I suppose I've little no choice[N]
but to take you at your word.[A][N]
Very well: you have your year.[A][N]
I shall relocate the king to the northern[N]
Madino Castle for his own protection.[A][N]
I'll also leave my Cross Knights stationed[N]
at Fort Sylvale.[A][N]
Offer even the slightest provocation,[N]
and your forces will have us to answer to.[A][N]
Remember, I'm holding you to your word.[N]
Break your promise, and we will break you.[A][N]
Do I make myself clear, Sigurd?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[N]
You know I'm not about to betray you.[A][N]
Please, Eldigan. You have to trust me![A][X]
