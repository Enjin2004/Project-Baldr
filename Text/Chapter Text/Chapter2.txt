##ImcaDied
[OpenMidRight][LoadLachesis][OpenMidLeft][LoadEldigan]
Lachesis, I'm leaving for Agusti.[A][N]
I can't rest until I've convinced King Chagall[N]
to end his foolish warmongering.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Please don't do it, brother![A][N]
You know as well as I that Chagall[N]
murdered his father himself.[A][N]
You'll only be endangering yourself[N]
for a lost cause.[A][N]
He won't listen to you![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You mustn't say such things about your king![A][N]
I, too, have heard the rumors of King Chagall's[N]
involvement, but they are just that:rumors.[A][N]
There remains no evidence against him.[A][N]
Surely, His Majesty will see reason in this matter,[N]
if I simply persuade him.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
But-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Enough![A][N]
I'll leave three of my finest knights here to[N]
defend Nordion, should the worst come to pass.[A][N]
Lachesis, you needn't look so sad.[N]
I will be back. I promise.[A][N]
I'm not about to abandon you in death.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Eldie[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##ChagallMustStop
Please, Your Majesty![N]
Reconsider your militant ambitions.[A][N]
Your father before you worked so hard[N]
to build an era of peace with Grannvale.[A][N]
A war will only bring ruin to our people,[N]
bringing disgrace upon your good name[A][N]
for generations to come.[A][N]
I implore you: do not start a war![A][N][OpenMidRight]
So it's you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Eldigan of Nordion.[A][N]
You dastard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] My father adored you, and you[N]
used his trust to undercut me at every turn.[A][N]
But now, my father is no more[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
And long live the king of all Agustria![A][N]
For years you've made me play the fool,[N]
and now, I will reward you in kind.[A][N]
Guards! Throw this man in the dungeon![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
W-wait![N]
Your Majesty, please-[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Pfeh![N]
Good riddance, the eyesore.[A][N]
Send my orders to Bordeaux at Heirhein:[N]
seize Nordion Castle![A][N]
Once that nuisance is dealt with,[N]
we're clear to throw all we've got at Grannvale![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadManfroy]
Your Majesty, King Chagall[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I see you've made your decision at last.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Manfroy? Yes, just as we agreed.[N]
Father is dead, and by my hand.[A][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]There is no turning back now. Even so,[N]
I still don't know if we stand a chance.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Remember, Grannvale still adheres to that[N]
tawdry old peace treaty with you,[A][N]
and their entire army is distracted in Isaach.[A][N]
Strike now, and you could not possibly fail.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
You're right.[A][N]
The downfall of Grannvale will mark the rise[N]
of Agustria as Jugdral's new leading power![A][N]
"Chagall, Emperor of the World"[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I like the sound of that.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Hmhmhm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][N]
We can only hope your ambition will be rewarded.[A][X]

##BackAtNordion
[OpenMidRight][LoadLachesis][OpenMidLeft][LoadEve]
Milady![A][N]
We've received word that Lord Eldigan[N]
was arrested in Agusti![A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?![N]
You must be joking![A][N]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Why didn't I try harder[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I shouldn't have let him go[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That isn't our only problem, milady.[A][N]
With Lord Eldigan gone,[N]
we need to be aware of Heirhein's movements.[A][N]
Knowing of his lordship's absence,[N]
a strike from them is inevitable.[A][N]
After the Verdane incident,[N]
they're most likely out for revenge on us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Especially after the death of Lord Elliot.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ugh, that Elliot[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I can't believe how many times I've had to tell him[N]
I'm not interested in him.[A][N]
Smug, self-absorbed swine like him are the[N]
absolute worst![A][N]
If only more men were cut[N]
from the same cloth as Eldie[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's too bad they aren't, else perhaps someone[N]
would stand a chance to marry me.[A][N]
Perhaps.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Be that as it may, Lord Eldigan's[N]
Cross Knights are still dispatched to the[A][N]
north at Fort Sylvale, well away from here.[A][N]
We three are all who remain.[N]
Nordion is vulnerable, and they know it.[A][N]
Rest assured, my brothers and I will do[N]
all we can to defend the castle,[A][N]
but the odds are against us.[N]
I'm sorry milady.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Very well. Thank you, Yves.[N]
But please, look after yourselves.[A][N]
Don't waste your lives for me.[A][N]
Be sure to tell Eva and Alva[N]
that I'm sorry for this.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
We are not worthy of such kind words, milady.[A][N]
Even so, Lord Eldigan handpicked us[N]
to defend you.[A][N]
Our lord gave us a task,[N]
and we will see it through.[A][N]
As paladins of Nordion, our lives are yours,[N]
no matter what.[A][N]
To our dying breaths, we live to defend you![A][X]

##HeirheinAttacks
[OpenFarRight][LoadPhilip][OpenRight][LoadGraham][OpenMidLeft][LoadBordeaux]
Let me get this straight.[A][N]
Eldigan ticked off the king and got himself[N]
a little prison time for his troubles?[A][N]
Ahahaha, that's perfect![ToggleSmile][N]
Graham! Philip! Lay siege to Nordion at once![A][N]
Let's see some tears roll down Eldigan's cheeks![A][N][OpenFarRight]
At once, Your Majesty.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenRight]
We won't disappoint you, sir.[A][X]

##NordionUnderAttack
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadOifey]
Sire, we have trouble![A][N]
It appears that Lord Eldigan has been[N]
taken prisoner and Nordion is under attack.[A][N]
I bear a message from Lady Lachesis,[N]
pleading for aid.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
They've taken Eldigan?![A][N]
Why[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Why in the world would they treat a man[N]
so esteemed this way?[A][N]
Inform everybody to make ready.[N]
We ride for Nordion at once![A][N]
No matter the cost, Lachesis needs us.[A][N]
He might never admit it, but[N]
Lachesis has always been dear to Eldigan.[A][N]
The loss of Lachesis would gravely wound him[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenFarLeft][LoadDeirdre]
Milord[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
You're preparing for another battle, aren't you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry Deirdre.[N]
I owe so much to Eldigan.[A][N]
I could never abandon his sister in a time like this.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I thought as much. I'm not about to stop you.[N]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I will accompany you.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?![N]
No, I can't allow that![A][N]
I refuse to endanger you like this.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
Milord, do you not remember our vows?[A][N]
You swore to never leave my side, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I am[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] uneasy[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I have a feeling that if you and I were to part,[N]
we would never find each other again[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Please, grant me this. Let me stay by your side[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] you're right. I did promise.[N]
Very well! Let us ride together.[A][N]
But you mustn't leave my side.[A][N][OpenFarLeft]
I won't.[A][X]

##ChulainnBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHolyn]
You’re challenging me?[N]
Don’t underestimate me.[A][N] 
Never know where you’ll come[N]
across a man with Crusader blood.[A][X]

##RecruitingChulainn
[OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent][OpenMidLeft][LoadChulainn]
Hah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][N]
Nobody here's ever bested me before.[A][N]
Who in the world are you, anyway?[A][N]
The way you fought[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
You were brimming with spirit! Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'd wager[N]
there's something you're here to fight for, right?[A][N]
All I've done is chase the money for all[N]
these years[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But I look at you, and suddenly,[N]
it all feels so meaningless.[A][N]
Hey, I don't suppose you're recruiting?[A][N]
Maybe using my blade for something real[N]
and grander than me is just what I need.[A][X]

##EthlynDeirdreTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadDeirdre][OpenMidLeft][LoadEthlyn]
How are you faring so far, Deirdre?[A][N]
I know my brother is worried something fierce[N]
about you risking your life like this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ethlyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][N]
Thank you for asking,[N]
but I'm doing just fine for now.[A][N]
Everything will be alright. I can feel it.[A][N]
So long as I'm at Sigurd's side,[N]
our happiness will see us through.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I don't think I've ever seen Sigurd as happy[N]
as he's been since he met you.[A][N]
He's pratically a changed man![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ethlyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Here. I'd like you have this.[A][N]
I've been meaning to give it to you for a while.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh? [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is- is this a light brand?![A][N]
Wow[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] These are so rare and hard to come by![A][N]
Are you sure you want to give me this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course.[N]
I know that it will serve you well.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I can't thank you enough, Deirdre![N]
I'll always treasure it![A][N]

##ElliotMonologue // Can be changed for Graham rallying his troops
[OpenMidRight][LoadElliot]
Lady Lachesis of Nordion, huh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I've been looking forward to this.[A][N]
She's been playing cruel games with my heart[N]
for years[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
But look how the tables have turned![A][N]
I've an entire army behind me, against[N]
her insignificant guard.[A][N]
What could she possibly do?[A][N]
She's powerless to resist coming back[N]
to Heirhein with me![A][N]
And who knows[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Perhaps one day she'll admit she wants it.[A][X]

##PhilipSpeech
[OpenMidRight][LoadPhilip]
Our task is to form a defensive line.[A][N]
Don't let the enemy lure you from your post.[N]
Stand your ground! Understood?[A][X]

##DeviousMacbeth
[OpenMidRight][LoadBanquo][OpenMidLeft][LoadMacbeth]
So, Heirhein's finally made their move[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Perfect.[A][N]
Release the brigands on the villages,[N]
as we arranged![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Your wishes are orders, sir![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
Under the old king, you couldn't even dare to[N]
meddle in any of his property[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Yet it is the easiest thing to cheat Chagall![A][N]
Strip everything of worth you find[N]
and bring it back here.[A][N]
Leave no stone unturned![A][X]

##ClementReflexion
[OpenFarRight][LoadHopper][OpenRight][LoadElling][OpenMidLeft][LoadClement]
Heirhein is going for Nordion's throat?[N]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] who do I side with here?[A][N][OpenRight]
Didn't you thought the Grannvalians[N]
fought with good intentions?[A][N]
Maybe they won't retaliate[N]
if we don't attack them first[A][N][OpenFarRight]
Yet, we can't disobey our[N]
king's orders[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Let's wait and see how this unfolds.[A][N]
Instruct the men to remain where they are[N]
until the dust settles.[A][X]

##RecruitingLachesis
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadLachesis]
Sir Sigurd![N]
Thank goodness you're here![A][N]
Things were looking so bleak for a moment[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm glad to see you're safe, Lachesis.[A][N]
What about Eldigan?[N]
Is he still being held?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes, he's still in Agusti[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
It's as if all the lords of Agustria have[N]
turned on us.[A][N]
Please, Sir Sigurd[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Lend us your might.[A][N]
No matter what it takes, my brother 
must be saved.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Of course. I've no fondness for bringing war to[N]
foreign lands, but in this case we've little choice.[A][N]
His Majesty, King Azmur, is aware of King Imca's[N]
assassination, and of Chagall's hand in it.[A][N]
He's received word of Chagall's ambitions[N]
to invade Grannvale itself,[A][N]
and has already approved military action.[A][N]
His Majesty also believes Eldigan's rescue to be[N]
vital if we're to put an end to hostilities.[A][N]
Rest assured, Lachesis.[N]
I swear that I'll save Eldigan[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##DewLachesisTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadLachesis][OpenMidLeft][LoadDew]
Hey! Lachesis![N]
There y'are![A][N]
Check out this little beauty of a sword![ToggleSmile][N]
Thought I'd give to ya.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oh? I can't say I've seen a blade[N]
so peculiar before.[A][N]
Does it have a name?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It's called a thief's sword.[A][N]
Wanna gut the bad guys?[N]
This thing's yer best friend.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Thank you.[N]
Although, why are you giving this to me?[A][N]
I'm hardly complaining, but surely[N]
you need a decent sword?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nah, I'm not bothered.[N]
There ain't any point in me keeping it.[A][N]
Let's just say it does a lot more than just stab[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Heh. See you around![A][X]

##GrahamBattle

##SigurdandGrahamBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadGraham]
You're the reason Elliot[N]
died to begin with![A][N]
I'll leave you no quarters![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd]

be a misunderstanding![A][X]

##QuanandGrahamBattle

Quan?[N]
What are you doing here?[A][N]
Are you also involved in[N]
the death of Elliot?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadQuan]
Graham[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
It's been a while.[A][N]
I'm sorry for your loss[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I know you and Elliot[N]
were very close friends.[A][N]
You shouldn't let your[N]
grief get the better of you,[A][N]
or else you might end up like him.[A][N]
Please reconsider about[N] 
leading this assault.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadGraham]
I've already made up my mind,[N]
I'll avenge him![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadQuan]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Sigh. I don't get it.[A][N]
No matter how hard I train or how strong I get,[N]
I'm still the butt of every joke 'round here.[A][N]
Maybe if I were more like Alec,[N]
with how he can attack twice[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
That'd be all I need to get a bit of respect,[N]
methinks[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
and maybe a cute lass while I'm at it[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile]Hee hee.[A][N]
But I'm still just me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][N]
Back to the ol' grind, I suppose[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Hang on?[A][N]
What's this little ring thing?[A][N]
Ooh, maybe it's one of those magical ones[N]
I keep hearing about.[A][N]
That'd be grand, wouldn't it?[N]
Let's try her on.[A][N]
Hm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Hwooooarh![N]
W-what's this power I'm feeling?![A][N]
Is this what Alec feels like all the time?[A][X]

Heirhein is secure, sire.[N]
What are you thinking for our next move?[A][N]
Do we pull out?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Hm.[N]
The imminent danger has passed.[A][N]
Nordion should be safe,[N]
but Eldigan is still being held in the capital.[A][N]
Furthermore[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yes?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I'm hearing that the frontier towns in the[N]
central forests are grappling with bandit raids.[A][N]
We can't afford to leave them be.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Agreed.[A][N]
It is crucial that we help the locals, that[N]
we might convince them we aren't their enemy.[A][N]
In that case, we must ride for the north at once.[N]
There's no time to waste.[A][N]
Let's go![A][X]

You imbecile![A][N]
You turned your back on this crisis to line your[N]

There had better be a good explanation[N]

Er, um[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

I'm stayin' put till I see how this all plays out.[A][N]
Oi, Beowolf, how 'bout you?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, I ain't up for this at all, Waltz.[A][N]

You're a free man, Beowolf.[A][N]
If a job isn't right for you,[N]
you're free to quit it.[A][N]
That's the funny thing about mercenaries,[N]
innit? Today's pals are tomorrow's foes.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Amen to that.[A][N]
Hopefully we're not gonna end up[N]
enemies someday.[A][N]
Wouldn't have a hope in hell[N]

What's that din outside?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Well, well! The bard's still here, are you?[A][N]
You oughta get outta here.[N]
We(ve got bandits headed our way.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Bandits,[A][N]
Isn't the Agustrian army doing something[N]
about them?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
The army?[ToggleSmile] Hah! That's rich, boy![A][N]
The army's too busy with their little civil war[N]
to deal with our problems.[A][N] 
Clearly that's more important than our safety.[N]
Actually, that's not all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][N]
Rumor is, the Lord of Infini himself[N]
is pullin' the bandits' strings here.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.[N]
That's it. That guy's gotta go.[A][N]
I'll go sort out the bandits, okay?[A][N]
Now, how big a reward'll be waiting here[N]
for me when I get back?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Still full of hot air, are ya?[N]
Just get outta here, wise guy.[A][N]
Nobody here's got the time to listen to you[N]

You're a dancer. I'm a bard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]

Oh, come on! Enough with the tears![A][N]
Things'll probably get more than a bit[N]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFinn][OpenMidLeft][LoadQuan]
Finn, these Agustrians are proving to be far[N]
worthier opponents than the thugs of Verdane,[A][N]
wouldn't you say?[A][N]
For stronger enemies, what could be more fitting[N]
than a stronger weapon?[A][N]
Let's see how you fare with this.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] a brave lance?[A][N]
Are you sure you want to entrust me[N]
with such a rarity?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. You are House Leonster's[N]
most promising young knight.[A][N]
You are our future,[N]
and I'd sooner see you live this day.[A][N]
Arming you properly is the best I can do[N]
to help for now, so yes.[A][N]
Take this spear.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What an honor, milord![N]
Thank you.[A][X]

##AlecandRossBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoss]
Putting you down is going[N]
to be child's play.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadAlec]
Why so confident?[A][N][ToggleSmile]
You clearly haven't seen[N]
what us Chalphy knights can do.[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadRoss]
Pfh.[ToggleSmile] And I'm the one[N]
being overconfident?[A][X]

##RossRetreats
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRoss]
Snap[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I'm really going[N]
to die if I stay here![A][N]
I'd better take away my pride[N]
and run as fast as I can.[A][N]
Infini is done for[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Maybe the new king could[N]
use my services[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][X]

Hey! Don't stay there kid![N]
This area is dangerous![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]
I heard Infini had plenty[N]
of goods to steal.[A][N]
Time to get rich![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadBanquo]
You're more fiendish than I thought![A][N]
It's time to teach you a lesson[N]
you'll be sure to remember![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadDew]

##SigurdLewynTalk
[OpenMidRight][LoadLewyn][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
Lewyn, I presume?[A][N]
The one who's been helping defend the villages?[N]
I appreciate the aid.[A][N]
As I understand it, you're a bard,[N]
but you also wield magic?[A][N]
That's unusual.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Something like that.[N]
I guess it's a hobby.[A][N]
You're that Sigurd fellow, aren't you?[N]
It's obvious what yours is: war![A][N]
Clearly you've got so much spare time,[N]
you spend it starting war after war![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Come again?[N]
You seem angry, but-[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Don't play dumb![A][N]
Think about the people of all the countries[N]
that you're flattening![A][N]
You come barging in, swords flashing,[N]
and all you do is ruin the lives of normal folk[A][N]
who're trying to make a living here![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
You're right. My apologies, Lewyn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I didn't even think about that,[N]
but I can't stand knowing I've done this to them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Words are just words without actions[N]
backing them up.[A][N]
If you really feel so bad, then why not[N]
pull your army out?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Mm, you're right[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Very well.[N]
I'll consult with my troops and arrange a retreat.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, you're serious about this?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Of course. I've been mulling over retreating[N]
for a while already, and you just gave me[A][N]
the answer to all of this.[A][N]
I've had enough of the war approach.[N]
I think I'd rather seek a diplomatic answer.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yeah, no.[A][N]
Trying to get through to Chagall now[N]
would be a total waste of everyone's time.[A][N]
Besides, if you lot pull out now,[N]
then nothing stands between a peeved king[A][N]
and all the citizens who've helped you so far.[A][N]
Are you sure you're okay with leaving them[N]
all hanging like that?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well, no, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ahahaha![ToggleSmile] Y'know, I guess I was wrong about you.[N]
You're alright, Sigurd.[A][N]
Say, why don't I help you finish this fight up?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Okay, I suppose[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Who are you, anyway?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Who, me?[N]
I'm just a wayward troubadour, my friend[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##SeizingInfini
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadOifey]
Sire, we have a visitor.[N]
Lord Rodan of Edda seeks an audience.[A][N][ClearFace][LoadRodan][OpenMidRight]
Lord Rodan, I presume?[N]
Thank you for coming.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Sigurd, the Agustrian conflict[N]
has escalated into full-scale war, I see.[A][N]
How does this battle look at the moment?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We're faring well so far, somehow,[N]
but this hasn't been easy by any means.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Incidentally, Lord Sigurd,[N]
I regret to say that I come bearing bad news[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's happened?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Nasty rumors have emerged of late[N]
in the royal court[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] and they concern you.[A][N]
The rumors claim that, in concert with[N]
Quan of Leonster and Eldigan of Nordion,[A][N]
you are conspiring against the crown.[A][N]
This, it is said, is why you are harboring[N]
the prince of Isaach in your ranks.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What?! That's absurd![N]
Who in the world could've started such nonsense[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Chancellor Reptor and Duke Lombard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I should have known,[N]
knowing their disdain for my father.[A][N]
Yet, to take that grudge so far[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Those two are ruled by their envy of[N]
your father's immense power as[A][N]
Prince Kurth's advisor, I'd say.[A][N]
They likely believe a Chalphy-controlled prince[N]
will strip them of their influence[A][N]
once he takes the throne.[A][N]
Fear and jealousy dominate their lives[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Don't let your guard down against them.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you, sir. I appreciate the warning.[A][N]
By the way, sir[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Pray tell, how goes the[N]
Isaachian campaign? Is there an end in sight?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
It seems there is indeed, from what we've heard.[A][N]
We expect the triumphant return of[N]
the prince and your father any day now.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank the gods Prince Kurth is safe.[A][N]
Losing him to this war would have dealt[N]
such a blow to Grannvale's future[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
I know my fater worries so about how[N]
the Belhalla lineage would end with[A][N]
His Majesty's death, unmarried as he is.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed.[A][N]
Before the war started, we were trying[N]
to hasten him to search for a wife.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
If I may, is there a problem?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] The story behind this has been well[N]
known in the royal court for a long time now.[A][N]
Regrettably, His Highness struggles to move on[N]
from a long-lost love.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Really?[N]
Why did he never marry this person?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Perhaps I ought to tell you the complete tale.[A][N]
This happened some twenty years ago.[A][N]
Prince Kurth had an affair with[N]
the duchess of Velthomer,[A][N]
a truly lovely woman as I recall.[A][N]
Duke Victor of Velthomer was[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Well, he was a philanderer of the worst degree,[N]
and had countless lovers.[A][N]
The prince, of course, is nothing like him.[A][N]
He wished only to support the duchess at first,[N]
but the two soon fell deeply in love.[A][N]
Victor was distraught, needless to say.[A][N]
He penned a letter denouncing the pair,[N]
then he took his own life.[A][N]
The duchess could bear to stay no longer.[N]
She fled Grannvale and was never seen again.[A][N]
As I recall, her name was Cigyun.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Wow. That's horrible[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
So she was the mother of Lord Arvis[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed.[N]
I can scarcely imagine what this was like for him[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Losing both parents at only the age of seven[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Mm. And yet, I feel sorry for the prince.[N]
Not to mention, for Cigyun as well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh! My apologies.[A][N]
I'm sure a soldier of your caliber has better things[N]
to worry about than court gossip.[A][N]
Please, don't worry about the story.[N]
You have a war with Agustria to win, after all![A][N]
Farewell, Lord Sigurd. We look forward to the day[N]
that you, too, return to the fatherland in triumph.[A][X]

##MackilyMobilizes
[OpenMidRight][LoadClement]
You can't be serious![N]
They've come as far as Infini?![A][N]
Are they just going to keep going[N]
until all Agustria is theirs?[A][N]
They'll have to come this way.[N]
We've no choice but to fight.[A][N]
Deploy the ballistae.[A][N]
We're all that stands between the capital[N]
and Grannvale's dogs of war![A][N]

##ErinysReadyToGo
[OpenMidRight][LoadChagall][OpenMidLeft][LoadErinys]
King Chagall, with all due respect,[N]
may we begin already?[A][N]
I need to find Prince Lewyn as quickly as possible.[A][N]
You said you know his location.[N]
That's the only reason I'm here.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Apologies for the delay, knight,[N]
but I just received word of a lead for you.[A][N]
I trust you've noticed we're currently contending[N]
with a Grannvale invasion?[A][N]
They have taken Prince Lewyn captive![A][N]
My scouts report that their army is arresting[N]
and executing anyone and anything[A][N]
which stands in their way.[A][N]
Your prince is being held in Evans Castle.[N]
Reports say that he is soon to face the axe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
No[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I can't allow this![A][N]
Thank you for your assistance.[N]
We'll leave to rescue him at once.[A][N]
Our queen, Lahna, cautioned us aginst[N]
clashing with other nations on our mission,[A][N]
but we may have no choice.[A][N]
Should Grannvale's troops cross our way,[N]
they'll be confronted without hesitation.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Oho[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] This is even better than I'd hoped![N]
Best of luck on your hunt.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'll be on my way, then.[A][X]

##AgustiMobilizes

##YoungMackilyKnights
[OpenMidRight][LoadHopper][OpenMidLeft][LoadElling]
Hopper, are you seeing this?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Yes, more of Grannvale are coming.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
They will attack Mackily next![A][N]
We gotta do something, we[N]
can't let Lord Clement perish[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
You've heard that there are some[N]
Silessian knights in Agusti, right?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, why?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I have a plan.[N]
I'll stay here with Lord Clement,[A][N]
while you and the Pegasi catch[N]
them off-guard.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Will that really work?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
We'll see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

You can call me Silvie if you want, though![A][N][OpenMidRight]

the time to look after children.[A][N]

back to the castle, alright?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Rrrgh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Good little girl?![A][N]
Look at me! How d'you look at someone this hot[N]
and think "little girl"?! What is wrong with you?[A][N]
Never thought ya'd be such a borin' old stiff[N]
just like everyone else 'round here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]

Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Oh, well. Back to being a lone,[N]

I guess we'll be here a while,[N]
so how about dinner sometime?[A][N]
Bet that'd be nice.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Ooh, yeah![N]
Maybe I'll dance for you too![A][N]
I've got a special one that nobody's seen yet.[N]
It's kinda embarassing, 'cause it's VERY special.[A][N]

What do you want?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Uh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Well, I just wanted to give ya[N]
a quick heads up about fightin'.[A][N]
See, war ain't the fun and games you're used to.[A][N]
And someone as green as you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Well, you're just gonna get in the way.[A][N]
Besides, a princess's a princess.[N]
Why not run along back to your castle now?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
H-how dare you![A][N]
My business in battle is just that:[N]
My business! Not yours![A][N]
I'll nail your foul mouth closed![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Heh.[ToggleSmile] You really are Eldigan's sister.[N]
Shoulda known you wouldn't be a pushover.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
What's that?[N]
Do you know my brother?![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Oh, yeah. Eldigan and me, we go way back.[A][N]
I'd never've been so nosy if he hadn't[N]
asked me to keep an eye on ya.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so?[N]
Oh, I'm sorry for snapping at you so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Eh, I've seen a lot worse in me time.[A][N]

Good. Mackily is ours.[N]
That leaves the capital, Agusti[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Indeed, sire, but don't get too careless.[A][N]
We've been informed that Agusti still holds[N]
a sizable defensive force.[A][N]
We ought to take the utmost care.[A][N][OpenMidRight]

How in the blazes will you fix this?![A][N]
Heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile] You exaggerate my role.[A][N]
All I did was advise the removal of the king,[N]

How is Sigurd's little army[N]
even this strong? This isn't fair![A][N]
Manfroy, I'm begging you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Help me.[N]
What am I supposed to do now?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
As I said, this isn't over.[A][N]
As a last resort, I do believe you have[N]
a fellow of use imprisoned here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Yes, I speak of Eldigan.[A][N]
Eldigan and Sigurd have been associates[N]
for years.[A][N]
Sigurd will unquestionably listen[N] 
to Eldigan's counsel.[A][N]
Of course, Eldigan can't do that[N]
while locked up, can he?[A][N]
Go apologize to him.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Y-yes, of course![N] 
Surely, Eldigan is the answer![A][N]
Now, if you'll excuse me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Ugh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] what a simpleton.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadEstrella]
Your Excellency, I bear news from the east.[A][N]
Just now, we received confirmation of[N]
the assassination of Prince Kurth.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so? Excellent.[ToggleSmile][A][N]
This grows more interesting,[N]
if I do say so myself.[A][N]
With Kurth's death there remains[N]
but a single scion to Naga's holy lineage,[N]
and that old fool hardly needs our help to die.[A][N]
And then, all that will remain is[N]
the restoration of the dark one,[A][N]
and then the world will belong to us[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What of Duke Arvis, Your Excellency?[N]
Is he in agreement with your plan?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Why, of course.[A][N]
As a bearer of the dark one's blood,[N]
what choice does he have?[A][N]
Not even one of Arvis's stature can[N]
afford the wider world learning of his[A][N]
dark heritage, lest he be burned at the stake.[A][N]
Could a man as prideful as Arvis[N]
bear to meet such an end?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
So he will betray his king and style[N]
himself emperor, and[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Indeed[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] But that will not be enough.[A][N]
Arvis alone cannot restore the dark god.[A][N]
We still need one more person[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
That woman's daughter.[A][X]

[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]What exactly are you wearing, milord?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What, this? I'm a bard now. [A][N]
You know, walking the land,[N]

What do you say: perfect, or perfect?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Er[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Perfect?[N]
But why, milord[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Aren't you supposed to be held captive at Evans?[N]
I got here as fast as I could, but[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
I'm imprisoned at Evans, am I?[N]
Where'd you hear that one?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
King Chagall of Agustria said so.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Chagall? Hah![ToggleSmile][A][N]
Hate to break it to you, Erin,[N]
but you've been tricked![A][N]
It's nice and all that[N]
you're so ready to trust,[A][N]

Oh, Silvia's[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Er, it's not important.[A][N]
Point is, what are you doing[N]
all the way out here?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Isn't it obvious?[N]
I'm here to find and bring you home, milord.[A][N]
It's been two years since you fled Silesse.[N]
Her Majesty is gravely worried about you.[A][N]
Please, milord.[N]
Come home with me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Do you have any idea what that'd do[N]
to Silesse, Erin?[A][N]
If I go back,[N]
I'll have no choice but to take the throne.[A][N]
It's my late father's will, but my uncles[N]
would never accept it.[A][N]
Just one false step and we'd have[N]
a civil war, just like here.[A][N]
And it's always the common folk[N]
who suffer for it![A][N]
If there are people who want[N]
to be kings or whatever, great![A][N]
Out here, though?[N]
I'm free, and I like it that way.[A][N]
I don't want a thing to do with that throne.[A][N]
For the good of Silesse,[N]
just give it to one of my uncles.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
I can't allow that milord.[A][N]
You know as well as I that kings of Silesse[N]
must bear descent from Forseti, the wind god.[A][N]
You, milord, are the sole living[N]
scion of his lineage.[A][N]
Neither of your uncles bear it.[A][N]
You milord, are Silesse's future![A][N]
Yourself and your uncles aside,[N]
all Silesse wishes to see you claim the throne.[A][N]
And[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] And your mother, the queen,[N]
was in tears when she sent me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Please, milord[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Come back.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Erin[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
Ugh, don't you start crying too![A][N]
Give me a break[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][N]
I can't stand to see a woman in tears[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Okay, fine. I'll think about going home.[A][N]
Just[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Give me some time[N]
to muster the nerve, alright?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Thank you.[A][N]
In that case, I'm staying with you until[N]
you're ready, milord.[A][N]
I'll send a messenger back to Silesse[N]
to report that you're safe.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Wow, you're persistent, I'll grant you that.[N]
All right.[A][N]
I think I'll stay with Sigurd's army for now.[A][N]
He's a pretty neat guy to work with,[N]
not to mention his army's full of beauties![ToggleSmile][A][N]
Hey, Erin, you could stand to get to[N]

What are you on about?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
My lord Lewyn is the rightful heir[N]

and is the sole inheritor of his power.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Wait, THAT Lewyn?! Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][ToggleSmile][A][N]
I knew there was something about him, but I'd[N]
never have thought him to be Silessian royalty.[A][N]
Any idea why he's pretending to be a bard?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
That's a long story, sir,[N]
and I'm hardly the most qualified to tell it.[A][N]
Perhaps try asking him later, but for now[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Fair enough.[A][N]
It's hardly my business, anyway.[A][N]
I'm glad you're here, Erinys.[A][N]
