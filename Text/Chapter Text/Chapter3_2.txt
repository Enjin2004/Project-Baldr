We've had this conversation before.[N]
I will not allow pillaging.[A][N]
My father, your brother,[A][N]

to the people. That reputation[N]
won't be tarnished.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]

The pair's treachery runs deeper still.[A][N]
The murder of Isaach's King Mananan[N]
was also the handiwork of Duke Reptor.[A][N]
He feared a peaceful end to the war would end[N]
the sole excuse for the conquest of Isaach,[A][N]
so he secretly had the king killed.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Is that so[...][N]
Reptor's grubby hands are all over this mess[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Not quite. In the shade of his avarice,[N]
there's something else at work..[A][N]
Something unsettling and terrifying.[A][N]
Not even Lord Bragi could scry this evil presence,[N]
obscured by its power as it is.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
An evil presence?[N]
Could it be that dark priesthood[...][A][N]
Wait! What of my father, Claud?[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Lord Byron yet lives, but is injured and weak.[N]
I fear he is not long for this world[...][A][N][OpenMidRight]
Father[...][N]
This can't be happening[...][A][N]
I'll hasten to the capital.[N]
His Majesty needs to hear the truth.[A][N]
Lord Sigurd, for the time being,[N]
stay here and restrain yourself from rash action.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Understood.[A][N]
I can't thank you enough, Father Claud.[A][N]
I beg of you, do everything you can.[N]
Save my father and his good name.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Our fates lie with the mercy of the gods[...][A][X]

You'll see how I deal[N]

##EdainandPizareBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPizare]
What is she doin' here?[N]
She shouldn't be there![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
You look distraught.[A][N]
I never knew I could[N]
inspire fear to a pirate.[A][X]

##PizareDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPizare]
D-damn[...][A][N]
Th-the pirates o' Orgahil[...][N]

##EdainandDuvallBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDuvall]
It's not 'cause yer now[N]
wearin' a fancy dress[A][N]
I won't go easy on you![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
I'm not sure I understand[...][N]
Do I know you?[A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadDuvall]
Don't play dumb, wench![N]
I'm the cap'n now! Get it?![A][N][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
There must be a[N]
misunderstanding[...][A][X]

##DuvallDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadDuvall]
N-no[...][N]
Damn it all[...][A][X]

##AyronBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
You're facing the Mage[N]
General of Friege, Ayron.[A][N]
Surrender or you'll meet your end.[A][X]

##EdainandAyronBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
Lady Edain[...] as expected,[N]
you're on that traitorous fiend's side.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
Sir Ayron, what are you doing here?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
I'm here on the Chancellor's behalf,[N]
to stop Sigurd and his accomplices.[A][N]
However, it seems I'll also[N]
get to avenge Darren.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
Stopping Sigurd and his accomplices?[A][N]
What does Darren have to do[N]
in any of this? I Don't understand.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
Please, do not feign ignorance.[A][N]
You're the only one who could be[N]
responsible for his disappearance.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadEdain]
I promise I'm not aware of[N]
any of this, please trust me.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
Enough, meet your demise![A][X]

##MidirandAyronBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
Sir Midir[...] so it is true then.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadMidir]
What are you talking about?[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
It's been months since Darren's[N]
disappearance.[A] You're the last person[N] 
he met in Verdane, according to his mother.[A][N]
I'm sorry to say, nonetheless, you do[N]
understand you're the prime suspect, right?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadMidir]
Are you serious? I'm his best friend,[N]
why would I cause him any harm?[A][N]
I didn't even know your cousin was missing.[A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
I regret I can't trust you, especially[N]
if we consider Lord Sigurd's betrayal.[A][N]
I'm sorry Sir Midir, but,[N] 
I have to dispose of you![A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadMidir]
Wait![A][X]

##TailtiuandAyronBattle
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
Lady Tailtiu![N]
Hastily get behind me![A][N]
It's dangerous around here,[N]
especially with this flithy Sigurd[...][A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadTailtiu]
Ayron, what are you talking about?[A][N]
You're mistaken, Lord Sigurd[N]
is the good guy here![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
I can't believe it![A][N]
Is he threatening you[N]
to say such things?[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadTailtiu]
No! You get it all wrong![A][N]
I'm on Lord Sigurd's side[N]
on my own behalf![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
It's worse than I thought[...][A][N]
He tricked you, there is no other way[...][N]
Please, listen to reason milady.[A][N][OpenMidRight][LoadTailtiu]
Ughhh[...][A][X]

##AyronDeath
[OpenMidLeft][LoadAyron]
Lord Reptor[...] my apologies[...][N]
I failed you[...][A][X]

##PirateTime
[OpenMidRight][LoadBrigid][OpenMidLeft][LoadDuvall]
Cap'n! Big news![N]
Agustria's lost th' war![A][N]
S'only matter of time b'fore them Grannvale[N]
guys're bangin' down our doors too, eh?[A][N]
What d'ya say?[N][A][OpenMidRight]
Damn it, Duvall![A][N]
The only reason they're coming is because you lot[N]
all went pillaging, against my orders![A][N]
You've got nobody but yourself to blame![A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Keh, enough![A][N]
I can't take yer arrogance anymore![N]
Shut it an' open yer ears![A][N]
Ya actually ain't the daughter o'[N]
the late cap'n, y'know.[A][N]
Yer just some li'l girl what the boss found,[N]
cryin' alone in this ship we raided.[A][N]
Th'boss jus' picked ya up an' raised ya 'imself.[A][N]
'Fore we knew it, ya'd all grown up an'[N]
were bossin' us all 'round, all nonsense-like![A][N][OpenMidRight]
W-what?![N]
I[...] that's[...][A][N][OpenMidLeft]
But yer li'l acts' worn its welcome out.[N]

You really think you clowns can take me that easy?![A][X]

##HuntingDownBrigid
[OpenMidRight][LoadDuvall]
Get'er, boys! Kill'er quick-like![N]
Don't let  'er escape![A][N][OpenMidLeft][LoadPizare][OpenMidRight]
Pizare, yer in charge o' the boys.[A][N]

Aye, boss![A][X]

##Havoc
[OpenMidRight][LoadPizare]
Righ', raise the bridge![N]
Agustria's all ours![A][X]

##ISawTheTruth
[OpenMidRight][LoadClaud][OpenMidLeft][LoadTailtiu]
Claaaaaud!C'mon, c'mon, c'mon![N]
Aren't you done praying already?[A][N]
Just look around! There'll be pirates all over us[N]
if we don't get moving![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Be at peace, Tailtiu.[N]
This was quite the fruitful journey![A][N]
Lord Bragi has answered my prayers and[N]
revealed to me the truth.[A][N]
It is precisely as I had thought.[A][N]
Not to mention, I even found House Edda's[N]
long-lost sacred heirloom within the tower:[A][N]
the staff of Valkyrie.[N]
See? This is it.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
What, that grubby little cane?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Tailtiu, please.[N]
Do try to mind your manners.[A][N]
This is a legendary magical staff with the power[N]
to restore life to the deceased.[A][N]
It is usable only by the direct descendants[N]
of Saint Bragi.[A][N]
That is to say, me alone.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Huh. So what you're saying is,[A][N]
with this rod you could bring my[N]
sweet old grandma back to life?[A][N][OpenMidRight]
Alas, most likely not.[A][N]
Valkyrie is limited in many particular ways,[N]
and so cannot be used on just any lost soul.[A][N]
You see, all of mankind is born[N]
bearing a life force called quintessence, which-[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Yaaawn[...] Er, what's that? You lost me.[A][N]
Why're you talking about this anyway?[N]
We've still gotta get outta here![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Ah, of course.[N]
Let us go.[A][X]

##SeizingOrgahil
[OpenMidRight][LoadOifey][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
Good. We've subdued the pirate castle.[N]
Oifey, would you please gather our troops here?[A][N]
Now that this all over,[N]
I'd like to ensure that everyone's alright.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
At once, sire.[A][X]

##BigTroubleInAgustria
[OpenMidRight][LoadLombard]
Is the army ready? Good.[N]
All units, move in![A][N]
Apprehend the traitor Sigurd[N]
and his cohorts![A][N]
Seize these viles allies of Byron,[A][N]
accomplices to his murder of Kurth[N]
and his bid to take over the kingdom![A][N]
It is the will of His Majesty![N]
No mercy for enemies of the state![A][X]

##DoubleTrouble
[OpenMidRight][LoadReptor]
Kehehe[...][ToggleSmile] Oh, Langbalt.[N]
Such audacity![A][N]
To think, he personally put an end[N]
to that miserable prince and[A][N]
nearly kiled Byron for[N]
putting up a fight[...][A][N]
I've never seen such a bold ploy! And with Arvis[N]
using His Majesty's trust, it all worked flawlessly![A][N]
Convincing the king of anything[N] 
is hardly a challenge,[A][N]
but to succeed with a tale of[N]
this scale takes quite the storyteller...[A][N]
And here we are, with the entirety[N]
of House Chalphy framed for the crime![A][N]
Heh heh[...][ToggleSmile] Our victory is all but assured.[A][N]
The throne of Grannvale shall be mine,[N]
one way or another.[A][N]
I'll leave no pest who dares interfere with me
alive[...][A][X]

##Treason
[OpenMidRight][LoadOifey][OpenMidLeft][LoadSigurd]
What in the blazes is this?![A][N]
I'm a traitor now, and a Grannvale legion[N]
now waits at our doorstep to arrest me?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sire[...] And to think,[N]
the war here was over at long last,[A][N]
and you were about to go and search for Deirdre.[A][N][OpenMidLeft]
Gah[...][N]
How could His Majesty have fallen for Reptor's lies?[A][N]
How could he possibly believe that[N]
my father, of all people, would kill Prince Kurth?[A][N]
Aah[...] If only Father Claud had gotten back[N]
to the capital before they struck...[A][N]
Why?! Why is this happening?![A][N]
I fought a pointless war, I let Eldigan die, and now this![N]
What have I been fighting for all along?![A][N][OpenMidRight]
Sire[...][A][X]

##MessengerFromSilesse
[OpenMidRight][LoadSigurd][OpenMidLeft][LoadAnnand]
Lord Sigurd, I presume?[N]
I am Annand, a knight in the service of Silesse.[A][N]
Queen Lahna bade my corps and I to come[N]
and retrieve you.[A][N]
We invite you and your subordinates to retreat with us[N]
to Silesse, until your good name has been cleared in Grannvale.[A][N][OpenMidRight]
[...]Queen Lahna of Silesse, you say?[A][N]
Why is Silesse willing to give aid[N]
to an alleged traitor like me?[A][N]
Please, sir. Time is of the essence.[N]
The Grannvale assault is sure to begin at any moment now.[A][N]
My pegasus knights will escort you across the sea[N]
to safety in Silesse.[A][X]


##C3_3VillageOne
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCurrent][OpenMidRight][LoadWoman2]
Ugh. I can't stand people like you who've[N]
nothin' better to do than start more wars![A][N]
Why are you even here? We've absolutely[N]
nothin' to do with Agustria or Grannvale![A][N]
Look. If you've really gotta fight, take it[N]
somewhere else, you thoughtless sod.[A][X]
