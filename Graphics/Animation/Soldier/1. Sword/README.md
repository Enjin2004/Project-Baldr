Flasuban sprited the base version of the FE10 Soldier.

Slow/Angled is Flasuban's first version.

Fast/Straight is a revision based off the vanilla GBA Soldier movements, made to look more like the GBA timings. This was animated by Nuramon.

Sword animation is based on the Fast/Straight animation done by Nuramon. This was animated by Craigrandall55.
